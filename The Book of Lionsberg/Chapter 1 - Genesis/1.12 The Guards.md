# 1.12 The Guards
We were able to covertly free the first few in the way the Spirit had freed us, but as the #movement swelled, the guards rapidly took notice. 

[[Our Plan]] had anticipated this. 

By the time the first 12 had their feet on the path towards liberty, it was clear the #movement might also be a war. 

_"Somebody stop them!"_ cried out a ghastly voice shrieking from the entrance of one of the Caves. 

Three beautiful souls chained within their domain had heard the whispers and were now moving towards [[Freedom]]. 

_"Don't listen to their whispers!"_
