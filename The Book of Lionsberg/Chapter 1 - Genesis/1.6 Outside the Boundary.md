# 1.6 Outside the Boundary
_"Wake up!"_

_"It is time."_

The gentle whisper of the Spirit nudges you awake. It is still dark out, and the endless sea of stars stretches out before you. 

As the Spirit has taught you, you begin your [[Practice]] with your first waking moments of [[Consciousness]]. 

It has taken many years of [[Practice]], but your [[Mind]] is now tranquil and at ease. It is quiet. It is still. And because it is quiet and still, your [[Spirit]] can hear Its Voice. 

You rise eagerly, and your body lifts itself up as if it has wings. Your strong muscles define a strong [[Body]], guided by a strong [[Mind]], guided by a strong [[Spirit]]. 

They are aligned in nearly perfect functional unity, because you daily forge them to be so. 

As you make your [[Way]] to your [[Place of Practice]], the first glimmers of a [[New Dawn]] begin to illuminate the world around you. The planets are still visible in their perfect alignments, as the stars retire from view. 

The gentle murmering of the stream greets your ears, and the song of the early birds begins to rise. The breeze in the trees, and the rustle of footsteps in the leaves begin to weave thier songs into the symphony of the new day.
