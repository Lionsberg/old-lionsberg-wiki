# 1.15 Dialogue and Circumambulation
_"Before we say much more, we should say something about the elementary act of speaking, and the [[Way]] we speak."_

As we uttered the words, from the back of the room we heard a distracting and discordant noise, and noticed that two of the pilgrims were chattering at [[One Another]]. 

We walked over to them, told them to stop speaking over [[One Another]]. _"That is not the [[Way]] we speak to [[One Another]] out here."_ 

We instructed them to repeat after us:

_"1, 2, 3, 4, 5 - I am fully awake and present."_

They repeated the lines and looked up at us. 

_"Are you here again?"_

A flush of embarrassment crossed their faces, as they realized they had fallen back into their chattering trance and disrupted the assembly. 

_"This will be common for a period of time as we work to liberate our [[Mind|Minds]]. It was not just your bodies that were held in bondage. We need to rewire our neural architecture and pathways, and we need to [[Help One Another]]. So if you notice anyone falling back asleep and beginning to mindlessly repeat the chatter of their cave, do as we did. Stop them, and have them count themselves out of the trance and back into the present moment and higher [[Way]]. Any of you, at any time, if you find your [[Old]] selves falling back asleep or your [[Mind]] starts to mindlessly chatter, can use this simple #tool to bring yourselves back to awareness in the present moment."_

_"Now back to the matter at hand. Before we speak further, we would like to speak about [[How We Speak]]."_

_"First, we would like to make sure that everyone understands perhaps the most fundamental word and method of speech, which is [[Dialogue]]."_

_"This [[Word Tool]] is bantied about quite carelessly by the chatterers in the Caves, however out here it has a very specific meaning. The word Dialogue comes from tktk..._

_"The second skill related to speech is [[Circumambulation]] or [[Circumnavigation]]. The word circumambulation comes from... x, which means around, and y, which means to walk. _
