# The Sovereign Vessels

_Say to the first few who awaken: 

We are [[All]] here aboard one [[Vessel: Earth]]. Where it goes, we [[All]] go. As it goes, so we go. 

We are [[All]] aboard a [[Vessel]] that is heading for destruction. 

Yet the [[Vessel of Society]] can be steered, and as it is steered you will discover that it and [[Vessel: Earth]] are one. 

[[Consciousness]] leads, and everything else follows. 

Our [[Consciousness]] is a form of [[Agency]]. We are [[Conscious Agents]]. 

As [[Conscious Agents]], we possess both inalienable [[Sovereignty]], and inalienable [[Free Will]]. 

It is these Truths that are the last best hope for [[Life]] and [[Society]].

Yet you have been asleep and enslaved. Held captive by structures and ideas that you were born and indoctrinated into, so that you could never recognize them. A fish does not know that was born into water, and a captive does not know that it was born into a [[Cave]]. 

Outside the Caves there is a [[Boundary]]. Outside the [[Boundary]] is [[Reality]]. 

[[Reality]] encompasses the Caves. The Caves do not encompass [[Reality]]. 

The [[Meta Vessel]] contains within itself a [[Vessel of Society]]. The [[Vessel of Society]] is  composed of billions of micro-vessels. 

Each one of these Vessels must be [[Navigate|Navigated]]. 

Right now, the Navigation systems of the Vessels have been hijacked by the Authorities of the Caves. The vessels are asleep on auto-pilot, chained to the walls of the Caves. Their collective [[Consciousness]] and [[Word|Words]], programmed by the Authorities, is what is propelling the [[Vessel of Society]] towards its ruin. 

[[Our Plan]] is to awaken the captives to their [[Consciousness]] and [[Agency]], and ask them to take back up their [[Sovereignty]] and consciously choose our trajectory. 

If enough of us choose to align our [[Conscious]] [[Agency]] towards the same [[Vision]], [[Intention]], and [[Goal]], we can alter the trajectory of the entire [[Vessel of Society]]. 

Each [[Sovereign]] [[Conscious Agent]], who possesses the ability to choose, is like a micro-vessel which must be steered. 

_If you do not steer yourself, you will be steered by others._

_If you do not govern yourself, you will be governed by others._

_Government is the act of navitating and steering._

_Self-government is the act of navigating and steering your [[Self]].

Each of us is rightfully the captain of our own vessel. 

Each of us is rightfully captain or crew on many vessels. 

Each individual, each family, each organization, each association, each institution, each tribe, each nation is a like a [[Sovereign]] micro-vessel which possesses the inalienable right to choose it’s own direction and destination. 

This is the basic principle of [[Self Determination]]. 

Each [[Sovereign]] vessel must govern, or steer, itself in accordance with its [[Purpose]], [[Principles]], and [[Goal]].

[[Sovereign]] vessels, which share a higher overaching and uniting [[Purpose]] and [[Navigate]] according to the same [[North Star]], can align together in various flotillas and fleets in order to progress more effectively and surely together than any of them could on their own. 

Each [[Micro Vessel]] is on a [[Micro Quest]] towards a [[Micro Goal]]. 

Our mission is to _align_ those Micro Quests and help them recognize that their success or failure is entirely dependent upon our success or failure together in the [[Meta Quest]]towards the [[Meta Goal]]. 

If we succeed in the [[Meta Goal]], we automatically accomplish [[All]] the Micro Goals of [[All]]. 
 
This [[Meta Quest]] is going to require a vast fleet of unprecedented size to set sail together. 

It is not ours to know whether and at what rate tens, thousands, millions, or billions of [[Sovereigns]] will hear the Voice, awaken, arise and join the epic voyage from the [[Old]] to the [[New]]. We do not know the timing, the waves, or the tipping points of the [Meta Movement] of all [[Creation]] towards its [[Goal]]. 

Yet we know that the moment that you, the Sovereign Individual, finally awakens, sees and understands, it triggers an immediate and inescapable moral imperative.
 
If you come to believe that you and all those around you occupy a building that is on fire, or a [[Vessel]] that is headed towards destruction, every single moment is a moral decision in which you simply are, or are not, doing everything you possibly can to get everyone you possibly can to safety.
