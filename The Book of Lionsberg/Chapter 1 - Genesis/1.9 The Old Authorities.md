# 1.9 The Old Authorities
As we prepare to renter the Caves, I must remind you. Do not trust the Authorities. 

Although they dress up in nice clothes, on the inside they are rotting. 
 
The institutions of government, religion, and society we have looked to for leadership in the past have become old, blind, corrupt, and incapable of arising to meet this moment in history. They cannot, and will not, save us. In fact, they will try to kill us. 

In far too many cases, their power depends on the ongoing poverty, suffering, and ignorance of the individuals and systems they are exploiting for their own narrow benefit at the expense of [All]. Without the captives in their caves, repeating back their words, they just chattering voices in the darkness. 

Yet there are some of us among them. Amidst the ranks of the Old Authorities I have met good souls, who are ignorant of what they are doing. When the liberation begins, they will join us.  
 
This means simply that we, [Sovereign] individuals around the world, must arise and unite to confront and overcome the total set of all existential threats, injustices, and corruption within a single generation, so that all future generations of life can flourish throughout the millennia to come. 
 
It is possible. There is a [Way]. But we must move quickly. Follow me.
