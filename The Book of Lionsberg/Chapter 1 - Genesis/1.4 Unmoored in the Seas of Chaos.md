# 1.4 Unmoored in the Seas of Chaos
Society has come unmoored in the midst of the storms, and is being violently driven and tossed by the waves in the roiling seas of [[Chaos]]. 
 
The Spirit that confronts and overcomes the darkest terrors and forges [[New Order]] out of their ashes is on the move. 
 
It is calling you. It is inviting you. 

_Deep is crying out to Deep. 
 
_"Awaken, arise, remember who are you are!"_

_"Courageously face down that which you least want to look at. Brave the storms you are most terrified to venture out into."_

_"Grab the helm and transform the [[Vessel of Society]] into an [[Ark]] that can carry all generations of life eternally onward towards thier [[Destiny]]._
 
The [[Vessel of Society]] must be consciously guided and steered. 
 
Towards what [[Destiny]] shall we [[Navigate]] the [[Vessel]]? 

Towards what [[End]] shall we [[Govern]] ourselves? 
 
[[Where We Are Going]]? [[Where Are We]]? [[Why Are We Here]]? 
 
Woe to the cowardly and blind leaders who drunkenly brawl on the bridge of [[Vessel]], while she lists and careens towards the rocks. 
 
Awaken and grab the helm! 

Arise, and remember who you are!
  
Take up your [[Authority]], and [[Navigate]] towards [[Life]]!
