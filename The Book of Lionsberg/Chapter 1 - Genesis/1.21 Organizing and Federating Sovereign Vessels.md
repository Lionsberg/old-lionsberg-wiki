# 1.21 Organizing and Federating Sovereign Vessels
"_In a few short hours, we will guide you out beyond the [[Boundary]]._"

_"As we mentioned earlier, the [[Way]] towards our [[Goal]] is marked by [[Milestones]]."_

_"As we begin to move towards the [[Milestones]] that mark the [[Way]] towards the [[Goal]], we are going to encounter [[Challenges]], [[Issues]], [[Obstacles]] and [[Opportunities]] that will require us to work together in various configurations."_

_"You will very quickly discover that life outside the [[Boundary]] is very dangerous and impractical if you are alone."_

_"We will therefore have to become very skilled at [[Organizing]] and [[Federating]]."_

_"The purpose of Organizing and Federating is to forge, out of many individual elements, a [[Higher Order Functional Unity]] that is actually capable of meeting the needs and solving the problems inherent in each moment of our [[Quest]]."_

_"Because this activity is so critical, we are continuously improving a guide to aid us in this area, called [[Organizations The Lionsberg Way]]."_

 _"Each time Individual Micro Vessels choose to organize and federate, they automatically create a new higher order Micro Vessel. Each one of these higher order Micro Vessels has certain functional capabilities." _

_"As we organize and federate, each of us will become captain or crew on many different vessels as we venture out together beyond the [[Boundary]]."_   

_"Like every form of Life, these higher order Vessels are never permanent. Like all elements of the [[Living System]], they are in a continuous state of transformation leading towards dissolution and the birth of something New."_

"_Every time something is organized and born, it is critical to remember, no matter how much we appreciate, love, or enjoy it, that it was born for a season. We celebrate both the green shoots of the leaves in the spring, their brilliant colors in the fall, and their grace in eventually floating down to the ground, to make way for the New that is coming after them._"

_"individual, each family, each organization, each association, each institution, each tribe, each nation is a like a [[Sovereign]] micro-vessel which possesses the inalienable right to choose it’s own direction and destination. This is the basic principle of [[Self Determination]]."_   

_"Each [[Sovereign]] vessel must govern, or steer, itself in accordance with its [[Purpose]], [[Principles]], and [[Goal]]."_  

_"[[Sovereign]] vessels, which share a higher overaching and uniting [[Purpose]] and [[Navigate]] according to the same [[North Star]], can align together in various flotillas and fleets in order to progress more effectively and surely together than any of them could on their own. We would highly caution not to attempt to navigate the waters ouside the [[Boundary]] alone. Many have tried, and few have returned."_     

_"Each [[Micro Vessel]] can be thought of as being on a [[Micro Quest]] towards a [[Micro Goal]]."_  

_"If we are going to succeed on our [[Quest]] towards the [[New]], we must align those Micro Quests and help [[All]] recognize that their [[Individual]] success or failure is entirely dependent upon our [[Collective]] success or failure in the [[Meta Quest]] towards the [[Meta Goal]]."_  

_"The basic #principle to bear in [[Mind]] is that if we succeed in the [[Meta Goal]], we automatically accomplish [[All]] the Micro Goals of [[All]]."_  
 
_"This [[Meta Quest]] is going to require a vast fleet of unprecedented size to set sail together. That is the purpose of initiating the [[Meta Movement]]."_  

_"It is not ours to know whether and at what rate tens, thousands, millions, or billions of [[Sovereigns]] will hear the Voice, awaken, arise and join the epic voyage from the [[Old]] to the [[New]]. We do not know the timing, the waves, or the tipping points of the [Meta Movement] of all [[Creation]] towards its [[Goal]]."_  

_"Yet we know that the moment that you, the Sovereign Individual, finally awakens, sees and understands, it triggers an immediate and inescapable moral imperative."_  
 
_"If you come to believe that you and all those around you occupy a building that is on fire, or a [[Vessel]] that is headed towards destruction, every single moment is a moral decision in which you simply are, or are not, doing _everything you possibly can to get everyone you possibly can to safety."_  

_"We have been talking too much... Go out and have another look at the stars, inventory your things, and we will resume shortly. Just a little more [[Time]], and we will be on our [[Way]]."_
