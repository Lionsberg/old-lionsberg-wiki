# 1.11 The Great Movement

[[Our Plan]] was based on our understanding that if we could get just a few moving and whispering as they made their way out of the caves, the Whispers of Truth would find their way into the next few ears that were ready to hear. 

[[One]] awaked 1. 
One and 1 awakened 2. 
2 could awaken 3. 
3 could awaken 5. 
5 could awaken 8. 
8 could awaken 13. 
13 could awaken 21. 
21 could awaken 34. 
34 could awaken 55. 
55 could awaken 89. 
89 could awaken 144. 

144 could awaken 144,000. 

144,000 could awaken [[All]]. 

Unbeknownst to the Authorities, we had left a series of [[Milestones]]
