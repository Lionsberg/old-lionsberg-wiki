## One Minute Summary

Hello friends and allies. 

I am a co-creator. I am passionate about bringing Intention Into Reality. 

Before founding Lionsberg, I practiced that by building projects, portfolios of projects, organizations that built projects, and portfolios of non-profit and for-profit organizations. 

After having my naivete shattered by confronting the corruption and injustice of the [[Old World]] and losing my [[Old Life]] in the process, I realized that the only thing I could ethically do next was to attempt to gather my friends and allies around the world to design and build a [[New]] one. 

Within me is the potential for every one of the total set of virtues and vices in humanity. I am doing my best to get those all under control, and to discover and integrate all aspects of my being into harmony with and service of [[One]] and [[All]].

Concurrently, I am doing my best to help [[All]] recognize both the Potential for Good and Evil within them, and to work together to discover and integrate all aspects of our beings into harmony with and service of [[One]] and [[All]]. 

I believe there this is entirely possible, and there is a very pragmatic and concrete [[The Way|Way]] we can do it. 

If we are going to pull this off, I need your help. And I would like to help you. Neither of us can succeed in isolation.
