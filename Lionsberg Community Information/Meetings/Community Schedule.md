# Community Schedule
We are working to grow and [[Get A Little Better Every Day]]. 

July 2022 Update: 

Our next stage requires that begin to coordinate and align our resources, plans, and goals. 

To make this easier, we are going to test out a new [[Battle Rhythm]] to create a [[Pulse]] for the emerging Community. 

## Asynchronous Communications
The vast majority of the work and relationship in the community is created asychronously and in small teams and groups. 

To stay connected, please make sure that you are engaged in at least one small team or group that you are passionate about. See [[Forging Or Joining A Team]] and [[Organizations The Lionsberg Way]]. 

## Attendence 
All meetings are voluntary. Everyone is welcome to be in Community in whatever ways they are most comfortable. 

Meetings will be broadcast and can be watched live by anyone with an internet connection. Meetings can be joined "live" by those who have agreed to the [[Lionsberg Community Agreement]].  

To limit the number of disruptive interlopers and spies to less than 10%, we are extending invitations to formally join the Community at the rate of 62% growth every 4 to 6 weeks. 

If you would like to be added to the waiting list, please let [[Jordan Nicholas Sukut|Jordan]] know. We are towards setting up an [[Onboarding Process]] and Team.
