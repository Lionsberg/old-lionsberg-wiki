# Game Design
I wonder if we could begin to discuss design principles, rough architecture, intentions. Here are several proposals. Does anyone have a proposal?

- [Civilization 2.0 the Game](http://www.game.civilization2.org)  
- [[Game Proposal from Bill and Jonathan]] early rough draft
- [Sense Craft](https://sensecraft.garden/files/sensecraft-storyboard.pdf)  
- [Terran Collective](http://terran.io)  

This page can become an invitation to all people who want to build something and are keen to move this forward.
