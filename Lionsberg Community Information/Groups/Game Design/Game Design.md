# Game Design
I wonder if we could begin to discuss design principles, rough architecture, intentions. Here are several proposals. Does anyone have a proposal?

- [Civilization 2.0 the Game](http://www.game.civilization2.org)  
- [[Game Proposal from Bill and Jonathan]] early rough draft
- [Sense Craft](https://sensecraft.garden/files/sensecraft-storyboard.pdf)  
- [Terran Collective](http://terran.io)  
- [Stacey's let's have fun together](https://chat.collectivesensecommons.org/agora/channels/sss-project)  

This page can become an invitation to all people who want to build something and are keen to move this forward.

## Must-Have Attributes
As a guide to our design, I propose that the following be built-in at the core of our game, and apparent at every level.
- [[#Fun]]  
- [[#Meaningful]]  
- [[#Useful Skills]]  
- [[#Relationships]]  
- [[#Collaboration]]  
- [[#Real World Problems]]

### Fun
Scientific experiments have concluded that people of all ages are more productive when what they are doing is fun.

### Meaningful
Most games are mearly entertaining or occasionally educational. What can set our game apart is that it means something to the player to play it. Meeting and collaborating with other players, solving real-world problems, learning skills rarely taught in our education system.

### Useful Skills
Our education system, with its origins in training soldiers and clerks, has mostly failed to teach us to think, collaborate, empathize, or communicate. This is a rather large opportunity for us tt

### Relationships

### Collaboration

### Real World Problems
