# Stories
Upon reflection. Stories are our soul. They tell us the truth about who we are. This is a good and wonderful gift. Naturally, it needs to be encouraged, nurtured. So, do you need to be heard? Say your truth. Anonymous or private as you like.

Imagine growing a huge collection of stories. Okay, imagine applying some modern knowledge and doing some techical wizardry with it. This might give us a way to watch our collective intelligence, live and unfolding. I think we are yearning to immerse ourselves in this. Wendy Elford as far as I can tell, wants to do exactlly this.

Fast forward into the future. Watching ourselves like this can make us easier to manipulate. Why? Because we will know ourselves rather well and tinkering will be rather tempting. We are talking about a gigantic brain washing machine. Same basic machinery as our current one, media, junk and more meaningless junk. No problemo. Now we feed it a better source of truth, our stories.

Perhaps we can do the same thing with our mattermost channels, our meeting notes.
