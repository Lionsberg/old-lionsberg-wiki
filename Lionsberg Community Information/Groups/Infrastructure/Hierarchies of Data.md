# Hierarchies of Data
As the number of records in any of our data tables grows too big to view in just one or two pages, it will likely help us if we assign categories to each record such that we can view just those few records that share a category. As the number of categories grows too big to display in a small widget, such as a drop down menu, it will likely help us to assemble them in a hierarchy and display it as a tree, for easy browsing.

Current hierarchal graph tools do a poor job of editing.
