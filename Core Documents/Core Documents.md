# Core Documents
This section in an index of the Core Documents, which are currently being drafted, with a target completion date for a provisional version by July 2, 2022. 

We will [[Act As If]] the Provisional Documents are official, so that we can learn from and continuously improve them. 

When the Provisional Documents accurately reflect what we are acting out, and what we are acting out reflects the patterns and behaviors we believe are most just, wise, and good, we will formalize the documents. 

The target date for formalizing the [[Provisional Documents]] is October 2024, in advance of the November 2024 United States Elections.
