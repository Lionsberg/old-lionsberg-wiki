# 0.3 Lionsberg
For various pragmatic reasons, it was necessary during the Genesis of this Program of Action to create a mythical Identity for the Community, System, and Structure that would be required to co-create the New World.  

After considering thousands of alternatives, the mythical name Lionsberg was selected. 

Like the [[Meta Project]] and like [[Worksite: Earth]] itself, no one owns [[Lionsberg]]. It exists purely on the basis of Governance, Culture, Process, and Voluntary Collaboration for the Good of All. 

It is critical to understand that the core infrastructure required to succeed in the Meta Project will likely _become_ the core infrastructure of the New World.
