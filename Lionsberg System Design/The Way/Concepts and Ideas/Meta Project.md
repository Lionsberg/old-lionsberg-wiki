# Meta Project

The [[Universal and Eternal]] program of action to accomplish our highest overarching and uniting [[Meta Goal]]. 

The word [[Meta]] as it is used in the [[Lionsberg System]] is meant to point to the eternal, universal, ultimate, self-referential, highest order, most transcendent conception of an idea. 

Therefore **Meta Project** is the highest universal overarching and uniting "project of projects", that by definition contains within itself and orders all other possible projects.

The idea of the [[The Way/Concepts and Ideas/Meta Game]] is critical because it provides a framework in which to stack up and align our individual games, with the various games we participate in, with the [[The Way/Concepts and Ideas/Meta Game]] that is big enough to unite [[All]].
