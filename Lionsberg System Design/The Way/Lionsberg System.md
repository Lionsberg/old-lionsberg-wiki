# Lionsberg System
The Lionsberg System is being co-created by bringing together lifetimes of work into one comprehensive and integrated system, purpose-built to create [[Throughput]] of the [[Total Nested Hierarchy of Goals]] contained in the [[Meta Project]]. 

It is an attempt to invite, empower, and inspire a global Force For Good to embody: 

1. A [[Meta Community]]  
2. A [[Meta Story]]  
3. A [[Meta Project]]    
4. A [[Meta Philosophy]]  
5. A [[Meta Science]]  
6. A [[The Way/Concepts and Ideas/Meta Game]]  
7. A [[Meta System]]  
8. Etc. 

The [[Meta Idea]] is that all these elements should and must Flow from one higher order functional unity if we are to succeed and avoid failure. 

The System is operationalized through sovereign and autonomous agents engaging in a [[Daily Practice]] that is (something like) the one outlined in [[The Power of Today]], that aligns energy and resources to collectively accomplish things that no individual or locality can accomplish in isolation. 

At its simplest level, it invites people to make and keep commitments to one another that meet needs, solve problems, and accomplish goals that they cannot accomplish in isolation. 

By [[Organizing]] and [[Federating]] through (something like) [[Organizations The Lionsberg Way]], and then working together through an Integrated Delivery System that is (something like) what is outlined in the [[Integrated Delivery Guide]], a indefinitely large [[Meta Community]] can effectively work together to accompish its highest overarching and uniting goals.
