This next section is even more of a [[Work In Progress]]. 

## Behavioral Codes and Values  
Through the course of human history, each tribe, people, and society has forged some kind of Code by which it has conducted itself. 

The Code governing behavior in a society is extraordinarily complex, composed of numerous layers and levels of abstraction, but generally including:  

### Explicit
1. A written set of formally adopted articulated and adopted laws and norms 
2. A verbally explicit / articulated set of laws and norms (not formally written / adopted)  

### Implicit 
3. Implicit laws and norms and that are somewhat consciously held, but not fully articulated 
4. Implicit laws and norms evided as held by embodied behavior, but not consciously held 

### Progressively Making the Implicit Explicit
There seems to be a process of embodied understanding at work whereby the implicit generally gets made more and more explicit across time. 

This occurs in two directions. 

First, starting in unconscious embodiment and progressively "ascending" up into Mind / Consciousness / Spirit as we figure out how to describe what we are acting out and why. 

Second, starting in Spirit / Consciousness and "descending" down into embodied actions as we figure out how to act out what has been spiritually or intellectually discerned. 

This relates to the fundamental [[Reciprocal Opening]] that is occuring between apparently opposing polar energies of Being and Doing. 

### Values 
Generally, these explicit and implicit Codes relate to [[Values]]. 

There are certain sets of behaviors that bring forth That Which The Community Values.

These sets of behaviors can forge more of less complete [[Pattern Language|Pattern Languages]] that any member of the Community can instantiate / embody in their own time and space. 

The total set of All members of the Community acting out the Code / Pattern simultaneously is what creates a cohesive, integrated, and well-ordered society. 

Generally Values are defined on two poles: Values, and [[Anti-Values]]. 

The Patterns associated with bringing forth [[That Which The Community Values]] can be thought of as [[Patterns of Success]] / [[Patterns of Life]]... 

...and the Patterns associated with bringing forth That Which The Community Does Not Value can be thought of as [[Patterns of Failure]] / [[Patterns of Death]]. 

The [[Patterns of Success]] bring forth that which the Community views as [[Good]] or [[Better]]... 

The [[Patterns of Failure]] bring forth that which the Community views as [[Anti-Good]] or [[Worse]]. 

### Value 
Our [[Current Best Understanding]] is that [[Value]] in the New World must be entirely redefined, and reconnected the Universal Values that flow from and are unified by the [[Meta Value]]. 

It is _only_ by entirely reintegrating our [[Total Nested Hierarchy of Values]], and fundamentally and foundationally realigning our notion of [[Value]] with it, that we can bring forth the New Economy and the New Society of the New World. 

This is a crtical notion _technically_ because we can now demonstrate rigorously using accepted principles such as [[Lean]] that the vast majority of human activity in the Old World produced Waste that actually _inhibited_ [[Value Creation]]. 

## The Meta Value
At the absolute top of this [[Total Nested Hierarchy of Values]] is [[One]] [[Meta Value]] that by definition unifies and coheres within Itself All other Values. 

Across multiple traditions, the "Spirit" of the [[Meta Value]] has been most commonly articulated with what in English we might call Unconditional [[Love]]. In other languages, such as Greek that undergird many systems of philsophy and religion, a more accurate and nuanced word might be [[Agape]]. Agape is used in texts such as the Bible for the reciprocal, unconditional, and ultimate Love of [[One]] for [[All]], and [[All]] for [[One]]. Or said differently of a Creator for Its Creation, and of Creation for Its Creator. 

From this single lens of Unconditional, Ultimate, and All-Encompassing Love, every other Universal Value and Good can be articulated, and apparently contradictory or competing Values balanced and held in Harmony. 

### The Meta Value In _Action_

It is the Powerful Motive Force and Intention of Unconditional Love, as a Living Spirit in Action, that is what reconciles, coheres, and orders within Itself what otherwise may be Perceived as contradictory Values. 

### The Meta Value in Lionsberg  

This highest uniting [[Meta Value]] is the Foundation, Center, Purpose, and Goal of the Lionsberg System. It is the One Thing around which All aspects of the System revolve. 

One level up the hierachy of abstraction, one understands that [[One]] is [[Love]], and therefore the [[Meta Value]] is [[One]], inclusive of the Spirit of the [[One]] that creates and sustains [[All]]. This understanding fundamentally unifies the Deepest Level of Abstraction in One Thing that coheres within Itself All other Things. 

Therefore the Foundation, Center, Purpose and Goal of the Lionsberg System and the Universe it serves is One. 

This is the entire basis of the [[Meta Idea]]. The [[Meta Idea]], the [[Meta Value]], and the [[Meta Goal]] are [[One]] expressed in various abstract ways. 

The Spirit / Logos / Logic of the One is the Spirit / Logos / Logic of the System, to extent that our [[Current Best Understanding]] is capable of reflecting that Ultimate Value and Good. 

### The Total Nested Hierarchy of Values
Cohered and ordered within the [[Meta Value]] is the [[Total Nested Hierarchy of Values]], or what we could consider "Universal Values." The total ordered set of All that is Good. 

Humans [[Act As If]] what they value most (aside from [[One]] / [[God]]) is Consciousness, and then Life. 

The only thing that Humans [[Act As If]] they Value more than Life and Consciousness is the Source / Mystery that is creating and sustaining Life and Consciousness. 

What is more Valuable, the Creation / Manifestation, or the Creator / Manifestor? 

What is more Valuable, the Golden Egg, or the Goose that Eternally Lays the Golden Eggs? 

One does not need to Understand the Mystery from which Life and Consciousness flows to humbly and reverentially relate to It as the Most Valuable Thing. This is as much of a Logical / Rational / Philosophical conception as it is an idea articulated through religion. 

Secular and religious philosphers alike understand the need for any System to be ordered and cohered by One Thing outside of it. 

The [[Absolute]] does not need to be articulated or concretized, and in fact should not be articulated or concretized, in order to be related to as the [[One Thing]] that orders and coheres [[All]] things within Itself. 

The Question that leads to the articulation of the [[Total Nested Hierarchy of Values]] is perhaps something like: What is the Spirit or Essence of that which creates and sustains Life and Consciousness? What does it Value and consider Good? What does it consider Anti-Good? 

This question can be held alike by religious and non-religious thinkers. The Logic is the same. 

If we desired to create, cultivate and sustain Life and Consciousness, what would we do? 

We can guess at what the Source and Sustainer of Life and Consciousness would do by putting ourselves in Its shoes, or by localizing the question and looking at what we _do_ when we Love something and deeply desire for it to develop into the fullness of its unique potential and flourish. 

### What is Good? 
From this standard, Good can be defined as (something like):

_that which causes Life and Consciousness to develop into the fullness of their Potential and flourish in harmony._  

Or 

_that which helps, and does not harm._  

Help what? Harm what? 

In a complex adaptive System of Systems, this question must be answered in terms of Relationship. 

Something is Good which Helps, and Does Not Harm, every higher order System that it is a part of, and every lower order System that is a part of it. 

At a minimum, this creates an affirmative duty of every Individual to Love, Help, and Not Harm every element of ones Self, as well as all Relations, Society, the Living System, and the [[One]] from which [[All]] these elements flow. 

Simply it creates an affirmative duty of every individual to Love, Help, and Not Harm [[One]] and [[All]]. 

Other areas in [[The Book of Lionsberg]] deal more technically and in detail with the interexistence of [[All]]. 

## Universal Values
Across time and space, what appears to be a core set of Universal Values has emerged. 

We know they are universal because individually we each can find them written on our hearts, and whispered to us by our conscious. We also know they are universal because we can find them written in the sacred scriptures and traditions around the world. 

Together these whispers and writings forge a [[Golden Thread]] laid around the world and throughout history, that when followed always lead back to Life and its Source. 

They can be called Values, they can be called Principles, they can be called Wisdom. 

Together, they provide a complete philosophy and ethic for life, that if enacted simultaneously around the world would cause the universal Symphony to be experienced. 

The timeless Wisdom, Principles, and Values that cause people and societies to flourish are not religious or philosophical abstractions. They are keys to life and death, heaven and hell, right here on earth. 

They exist to help individuals and societies understand how integrate and order themselves, and how to live their lives. 

They tell us how to move away from our present suffering and dysfunction towards something better. 

They tell us how to avoid being swept off the path on our individual and collective Quest to climb the sacred mountain towards our Destiny. 

They are the safeguards, the guardrails, and the boundaries. They are the Universal Law that enables us to know what we can expect from one another as we labor together towards the Goal. 

And they are inviolable if we want to dwell in peace and harmony, for neither our internal conscience nor our external wars will allow us to rest until we harmonize ourselves with One Another. 

And if 8 or 10 billion of us want to harmonize ourselves with One Another, the only possible and logical Way is to All harmonize our Selves to the One Thing that unites us All. 

What we all have in common is Life and Consciousness. 

And the only greater commonality and Value than Life and Consciousness is the Mystery of the Source from which All generations of Life and Consciousness flow. 

The only possible logic that can solve the equation and lead to our children and grandchildren flourishing in harmony is if we All harmonize our Selves to One Logic of Love. 

#### A Basic Statement of Love

We recognize your unique identity and inherent value as a human being. We Love You. We Love Your Children and Grandchildren. We Love Life. We Love Consciousness. We Love the Source and Sustainer of Life and Consciousness. We desire for you, for your family, for your tribe, for your people to develop into the fullness of your unique potential and flourish in service of All things striving towards the fullness of their unique potentials. 

#### A Basic Statement of Interdependence
We recognize that we cannot develop into the fullness of our unique potential, unless and until you develop into the fullness of your unique potential. 

We recognize that you cannot develop into the fullness of your unique potential, unless and until we develop into the fullness of our unique potential. 

We recognize that neither of us can develop into the fullness of our potential, unless we [[Help One Another]]. 

#### A Basic Statement of Right Relationship
We would like to help you. We would like to serve you. We would like to be in Right Relationship with you. 

Our [[Current Best Understanding]] of Right Relationship is that we do our best to [[Help One Another]], and not [[Harm One Another]], as we work together in service of the One overarching and uniting [[Meta Goal]]. 

#### A Basic Pledge of Universal Values 
To harmonize ourselves with One Another, the Living System, and the One Thing that unites All things, we pledge to do our best to uphold our shared universal values. 

At various levels of detail and abstraction, these can be described with words like: 

- The [[Meta Value]] / Love
____
- Truth, Love, Justice, Stewardship, and Wisdom. 
___
- Joy, Peace, Patience, Kindness, Goodness, Faithfulness, Gentleness, Humility, Self-Control, and Non-Violence.  
___
- Agency, Autonomy, Competence, Conscientiousness, Respect, Dignity, Happiness, Creativity, Freedom, Curiosity, Adventure, Understanding, Beauty, Enjoyment, Freedom from Fear, Honesty, Forgiveness, Loyalty, Responsibility, Fellowship, Friendship, Tradition, Moderation, Cleanliness, Security, Reciprocity, Wellbeing, Belonging, Spirituality, Purpose, Meaning, Compassion, Regeneration, Recreation, Independence, Community, Service, Hope, Perseverance, Gratitude, Generosity, Courage, 
____
#### Integration and Alignment of Power and Resources 

Whereas that we are beings in motion, and there is work to be done, and work demands power and resources to accomplish it...

And whereas if power and resources become the Goal we destroy our Selves, our Right Relationship, and our world...

We pledge to only develop as much power and resources as are necessary to accomplish [[The Goal]]. 

We pledge to integrate and align the fullness of any power, leadership, or resources entrusted to us in service of [[One]], [[All]], and the [[The Goal]], to Help, and not to Harm. 

## The Lionsberg | Meta Code
The Question that leads to the articulation of the Code / Way of Being is something like: What would the Spirit of That Which Creates, Sustains, and Enlightens Life and Consciousness _Do_? How would It show up in our Time and Place? How would It Be [[Here]] and [[Now]]? How would It Act [[Here]] and [[Now]]? What would It Do?  

Because Values are abstract, and we have difficulty translating them into the concrete behaviors and Patterns of Thought, Speech, and Action that cause them to manifest, humanity has discovered that it is (at least initially) necessary to translate our shared Values into a Behavioral Code. 

The Code articulates, in concrete and relatable ways, how the Values show up in our [[Way of Being]] and our [[Way of Doing]] what we are compelled to do. 

From the Spirit behind the list of Universal Values above, we have derived a Provisional Code composed of 100 concrete behaviors that, to our [[Current Best Understanding]], consitute an approximation of some basic [[Patterns of Life]]. 

We call it the Lionsberg | Meta Code to different our articulation of it from the Absolute / Eternal / Universal understanding of it that is beyond words. 

We acknowledge that this Meta Code is only a shallow and surficial articulation of the Spirit that impells us to do our best to act perfectly, wisely, and rightly in service of [[One]] and [[All]]. 

Nevertheless, recognizing the need to forge a basis for continuously improving our articulation and embodiment of it, we establish the following as our [[Current Best Understanding]] and approximation:

## A Return to Simplicity 
The [[Meta Code]] can be described in One word like One or Love. 

In can be described in Five words like Truth, Love, Justice, Stewardship, and Wisdom. 

It can be described in 100 concrete behaviors that are likely to manifest from it. 

Or it can be described in 1,000 things that one should do, and 1,000 things that one should not do, in 1,000 different situations. 

For this reason, the Way must be understood and applied in Spirit, not Word. 

If you do not resonate with the Code above, develop your own! And try to make it a little better every day.  

One can never discover the Way through intellectual learning. To know the Way, one must live it and discover it experientially by learning how to allow the Spirit of It to flow through them spontaneously and accurately into whatever time, place, or situation they find themselves in. 

With Love, In Community,
