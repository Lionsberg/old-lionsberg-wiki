## The Meta Code 
Through the course of human history, each tribe, people, and society has forged some kind of Code by which it has conducted itself. 

The Code governing behavior in a society is extraordinarily complex, composed of numerous layers and levels of abstraction, but generally including:  

### Explicit
1. A written set of formally adopted articulated and adopted laws and norms 
2. A verbally explicit / articulated set of laws and norms (not formally written / adopted)  

### Implicit 
3. Implicit laws and norms and that are somewhat consciously held, but not fully articulated 
4. Implicit laws and norms evided as held by embodied behavior, but not consciously held 

### Progressively Making the Implicit Explicit
There seems to be a process of embodied understanding whereby the implicit generally gets made more and more explicit. 

This seems to function a way that is in a strange way the opposing pole to the way we often refer to [[Realize|Realization]] as being lead by the Spirit / Mind, then descending into Body. 

In this counter pattern Realization is happening in reverse, starting in Embodiment and then ascending up into Mind / Spirit. 

This relates to the fundamental [[Reciprocal Opening]] that is occuring between apparently opposing polar energies. 

### Values 
Generally, these explicit and implicit Codes relate to [[Values]]. 

There are certain sets of behaviors that bring forth That Which The Community Values.

These sets of behaviors can forge more of less complete [[Pattern Language|Pattern Languages]] that any member of the Community can instantiate / embody in their own time and space. 

The total set of All members of the Community acting out the Code / Pattern simultaneously is what creates a cohesive, integrated, and well-ordered society. 

Generally Values are defined on two poles, Values, and [[Anti-Values]]. 

The Patterns associated with bringing forth [[That Which The Community Values]] can be thought of as [[Patterns of Success]] / [[Patterns of Life]]... 

...and the Patterns associated with bringing forth That Which The Community Does Not Value can be thought of as [[Patterns of Failure]] / [[Patterns of Death]]. 

The [[Patterns of Success]] bring forth that which the Community views as [[Good]] or [[Better]]... 

The [[Patterns of Failure]] bring forth that which the Community views as [[Anti-Good]] or [[Worse]]. 

### Universal Values
Across time and space, a core set of Universal Values has emerged. 

### The Meta Code
Because Values are abstract
