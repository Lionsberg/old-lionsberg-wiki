If We are going to [[Move]] through the [[Unknown]] towards our [[Goal]], We will need a means of [[Navigate|Navigating]]. 

Then we need to engage in the [Discipline] to execute an [Integrated Practice] that produces [Progress] towards our [Goal]. 

Our [Lives] are like a [System] designed to produce [Something]. 

The [Success] of our [Lives] is measured in [Throughput] of our [Meta Goal]. 

Our [Lives] are like a [Quest] towards a [Goal]. 

The [Success] of our [Quest] is measured in [Progress] towards our [Meta Goal].
