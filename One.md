# One
In the [[Lionsberg System]], [[One]] is used as a [[Word Tool]] to point to the same [[Ultimate Reality]] that English word tools such as [[God]], [[Source]], [[Absolute]], [[Creator]], etc. point to. 

It refers to the [[One]] thing from / through which [[All]] other things arise. 

Rather than adopt any existing concretization of the [[Absolute]], the [[Lionsberg System]] intentionally leaves this in the [[Abstract]] so that it stays transcendent of all human ideology, and so that people from many different perspectives and systems of belief can relate to it and wrestle with it. 

By putting our Selves in service of [[One]] and [[All]], we are compelled to align our [[Aim]] with the [[Highest Intention and Greatest Good]] of which we can presently conceive. 

WARNING: Do not attempt to [[Concretizing The Absolute|Concretize The Absolute]] or the System will fail! In religious terms, reducing [[Ultimate Reality]] to a human-made set of forms or propositions is akin to [[Idolatry]].
