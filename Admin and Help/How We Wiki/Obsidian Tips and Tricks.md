# Obsidian Tips and Tricks

We'll put settings, recommended plugins, and other information here.

See [[Obsidian Git]] for push and pull commands. 

## Obsidian Tips

- Collapse All - simple, useful button for the file navigator
- Find unlinked files and unresolved links - a little funky how it works, but super useful as you're building an information space
- Page Heading From Links - automatically creates the header line in pages created by clicking on an incipient link
- Command + L Pulls from the cloud
- Command + U Pushes
	- Recommendation - Before you Push, click Command + S to make sure that the current page is saved. If you type something and immediately hit Push, you may miss the last changes.
