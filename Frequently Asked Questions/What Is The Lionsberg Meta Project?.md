# What Is The Lionsberg Meta Project?
Hello! We are glad you asked. 

This is a massive concept with many moving parts. We understand that it can be confusing. 

[[Lionsberg]] is just a mythical name for something we are trying to bring into reality, which is a coordinated global community of goodwill working together to design and build a better world. 

This happens in two interrelated categories: 

1. Inspiring a diverse global community to design and build itself (Relationship / Being)  
2. Working together to design and build the best possible future for all (Action / Doing)  

The [[Meta Project]] is simply a word tool we use to point at the total set of all possible projects and activity required to: 

1. Solve the total set of grand challenges
2. Accomplish the total set of global goals
3. Forge the best possible future for All

The word [[Meta]] as it is used in the [[Lionsberg System]] is meant to point to the eternal, universal, ultimate, self-referential, highest order, most transcendent conception of an idea. 

Therefore [[Meta Project]] is the highest universal overarching and uniting "project of projects", that by definition contains within itself and orders all other possible projects.

The idea of the [[Meta Project]] is critical because it provides a framework in which to stack up and align our individual projects, with the various projects we participate in, with the [[Meta Project]] that is big enough to unite [[All]].  

The basic idea is to [[Act As If]] we were all working towards one [[Meta Goal]] that integrated and united all other Goals, and to figure out how to organize ourselves in order to succeed.
