# The Meta Story

## Progress
Humanity has made tremendous progress over the past few centuries.
 
From science and technology to infrastructure, new advancements have allowed us to double the average human lifespan, establish global systems and infrastructure, and connect with one another in ways we never thought possible. 

## Crisis
 
Yet many of the hastily erected structures of [[Economy]], [[Government]], and [[Society]] are pushing humanity and the [[Living System]] to the brink. 
 
The very systems we stood up to solve our most pressing threats in previous centuries are now creating an entirely new class of existential threats. These complex, interrelated crises threaten to grow exponentially as we accelerate technology, a science, and industry along these same paths. 

Increasingly, we are coming to understand that what appear to be discrete crises are really all symptoms of a far deeper [[Meta Crisis]]. 

It is becoming apparent that an unprecedented [[Meta Crisis]] demands an unprecedented  [[Meta Solution]]. 

## International and National Efforts 
 
Organizations like the United Nations have awaken a first step at identifying some shared declarrations and global goals. 

While these efforts have produced important declarations and shared statements of intent, they have also been beset by political machinations and fall far short of what true transformational [[Justice]] would demand. 
 
At this unique moment in history when we need to work together to solve these crises and forge a better future, we find ourselves in a highly fragmented and dysfunctional social and political environment. 

The public has largely lost faith in transparency and accountability of our elected officials and political parties, with only 1 in every 3 or 4 citizens around the world believing we are heading in the right direction. 
 
The institutions and leadership that we have looked to in the past have failed to forge the functional unity that is required to succeed, and avoid failure, in the face of these issues. 

## Local and Private Sector Efforts 
 
Against this backdrop, local governments, individuals, and organizations are spending trillions of dollars and volunteering billions of hours each year in attempts to address these problems. 
 
Yet despite the heroic efforts of individuals and organizations around the globe, many of these efforts are running inefficiently in parallel, focused on the symptoms rather than the root causes, hopelessly divided, and lacking the coordination and transparency needed to achieve the true systemic transformation that is required. 

It is clear that what got us here, will not get us to where we want to go. No increased amount of what we are currently doing will ever result in the kind of world we all desire. 
 
History has shown us that when we work together, we can achieve seemingly impossible things. 
 
We have built cities, roadways, and technology that have transformed every aspect of culture and commerce. 
 
Whether it is building infrastructure, sending a rover to Mars, or eradicating a disease, success at this scale requires world class coordination, logistics, and training. 
 
Confronting and overcoming the current global complex of crises and forging the flourishing [New World] from their ashes, will require no less. 
 
It will require a complete story, intention, philosophy, structure, and [Way] of being, operationalized at scale and powerful enough to vanquish the existential threats that are stalking us, and forge a better for future for all generations of life. 
 
Everything that we need to know in order to succeed and avoid failure at this critical juncture is alive within us. Waiting. Longing to be realized. It has been perpetually spoken by the [Spirit] that lays the golden thread through the universe, history, and consciousness. It has been confirmed by a thousand messengers, and articulated in the dogma of a thousand institutions. Yet it has been lost and ignored to our peril. 
 
If we simply listen and heed the eternal voice, and allow it to guide us in the eternal [Way], the [New World] will in-break and emerge in all its fullness.
