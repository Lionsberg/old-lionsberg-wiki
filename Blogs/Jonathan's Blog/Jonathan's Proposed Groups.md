# Jonathan's Proposed Groups
Over the years, in my more optimistic moments, I've let my imagination loose on how a perfect world might look. A lot of this grew from being too sensitive and knowing this, I played devil's advocate a lot, pruning here and there. This seems like a good place for me to share the resulting brew. Here are a few groups I have in mind.

[[Education and Training]]

 I've been calling them guilds because I like combining autonomy, craftmanship and education into each one. Each guild may prefer specialized in-house training for a lot of its skills. Students who work hard at learning will probably do just fine with freely available high quality training.
