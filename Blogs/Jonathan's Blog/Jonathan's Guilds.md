# Jonathan's Guilds
Over the years, in my more optimistic moments, I've let my imagination loose on how a perfect world might look. A lot of this grew from being too sensitive and knowing this, I played devil's advocate a lot, pruning here and there. This seems like a good place for me to share the resulting brew. Here are a few groups I have in mind. I've been calling them guilds.

[[Education and Training]]  

I like combining autonomy and tradecraft with education. For the simple reason that each guild may prefer specialized in-house training for a lot of its skills. Generic education often reduces to least common material.
