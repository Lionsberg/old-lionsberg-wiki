# Jonathan's Blog
I have the soul of an artist and think in 3D. Everything visual is for me more basic than language. But then, language can be amazing. I love that humans invented language and upset at how we have weaponized it. The non-technical skills I am learning include collective intelligence, empathy, writing. I've been writing code for 40 years.

This world is not set up for most of us to thrive. I've responded by being optimistic and thinking it could be. I've let my imagination loose on how a perfect world might look. [I wrote about it here](http://www.civilization2.org). Day dreamed about it. Pruned it. Fussed with it. The Meta Project seems like a good place for me to share the resulting brew. I am adding fresh material as initial discussion topics to our wiki based on this earlier work.
