# Jonathan's Blog
I have the soul of an artist and think in 3D. Everything visual is for me more basic than language. But then, language can be amazing. I love that humans invented language and disappointed at how we have weaponized it. I seek to avoid that. My non-technical skills include collective intelligence, empathy, writing.

This world is not set up for most of us to thrive. I think it could be. In my more optimistic moments, I've let my imagination loose on how a perfect world might look. [I wrote about it here](http://www.civilization2.org). Day dreamed about it. Pruned it. Fussed with it. The Meta Project seems like a good place for me to share the resulting brew. 

Here are a few groups I have in mind. I call them guilds.

[[Onboarding Process]]  
[[Education and Training]]  
[[Needs Guild]]  

I like combining autonomy and tradecraft with education. For the simple reason that each guild may prefer specialized in-house training for a lot of its skills. Generic education can then focus on a smaller set of common material.
