I have the soul of an artist and think in 3D; everything visual is for me more basic than language. On the other hand, language can be amazing. I love that humans invented it. I am puzzled at how we have weaponized it. The non-technical skills I am learning include collective intelligence, empathy, writing. I've been writing code for 40 years.

This world is not set up for most of us to thrive. This strikes me as dumb. We can do way better and now is the time to do it. So, what do you think? How might a perfect world look? As an exercise in imagination, [I wrote about it here](http://www.civilization2.org). I suck at marketing it.

So here I am. The Meta Project seems like a good place for me to share it. Hesitantly, I am adding some of my ideas to this wiki:

[[Education and Training]]  
[[Guilds]]  
[[Needs Guild]]  
[[Onboarding Process]]  

I'm also working with Bill Larson on an idea:

[[Bootstrap Funding]]
