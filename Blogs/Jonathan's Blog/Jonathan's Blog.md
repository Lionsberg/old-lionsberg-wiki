I have the soul of an artist and think in 3D. Everything visual is for me more basic than language. But then, language can be amazing. I love that humans invented language and disappointed at how we have weaponized it. I seek to avoid that. My non-technical skills include collective intelligence, empathy, writing.

This world is not set up for most of us to thrive. I think it could be. In my more optimistic moments, I've let my imagination loose on how a perfect world might look. [I wrote about it here](http://www.civilization2.org). Day dreamed about it. Pruned it. Fussed with it. The Meta Project seems like a good place for me to share the resulting brew. I am adding fresh material to our wiki based on my early work. I offer it as initial discussion topics.
