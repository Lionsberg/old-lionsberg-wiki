I have the soul of an artist and think in 3D. Everything visual is for me more basic than language. But then, language can be amazing. I love that humans invented language and disappointed at how we have weaponized it. I seek to avoid that.

This world is not set up for most of us to thrive. I think it could be. In my more optimistic moments, I've let my imagination loose on how a perfect world might look. [Wrote about it](http://www.civilization2.org). Day dreamed about it. Pruned it. Fussed with it. This seems like a good place for me to share the resulting brew. 

Here are a few groups I have in mind. I call them guilds.

[[Onboarding Process]]  
[[Education and Training]]  

I like combining autonomy and tradecraft with education. For the simple reason that each guild may prefer specialized in-house training for a lot of its skills. Generic education often reduces to least common material.
