# 1.2 Today

The basic unit of eternity is now. 

This moment. 

Today.

There is never anywhere else we get to live.

Each and every cycle of 24 hours, given to us one moment at a time, determines our [[Destiny]]. 

Great temples are not built all at once. They are built up brick by brick. 

Each and every day is like a building block in the great temple we are co-creating. 

If we want to transform our lives and our world, we must start by transforming today. 

If we want to transform today, we must transform our [[Way]].
