# 14. Prerequisites To A Great Day
As beings in motion, we are always moving and transforming towards something. 

If great day is one in which We [[Exist]] in a [[Way]] that produces [[Progress]] towards our [[Aim]], then we understand that are [[Prerequisite|Prerequisites]] that must be accomplished before the possibility of having a great day exists. 

There are conditions that must be satisfied before the possiblity of greatness can emerge. 

The main prequisite to a great day is to decide [[Where We Are Going]] and [[Why]]. 

This is the first great moral decision of any life: the choice of an [[Aim]]. 

The importance of this [[Choice]] cannot possibly be overstated, because it determines not only [[Where We Are Going]], but also how we fundamentally [[Perceive]] and Experience [[Reality]]. 

Once we decide [Where We Are Going] and [Why]â€¦

Then we need to engage in the [Discipline] to execute an [Integrated Practice] that produces [Progress] towards our [Goal]. 

Our [Lives] are like a [System] designed to produce [Something]. 

The [Success] of our [Lives] is measured in [Throughput] of our [Meta Goal]. 

Our [Lives] are like a [Quest] towards a [Goal]. 

The [Success] of our [Quest] is measured in [Progress] towards our [Meta Goal].
