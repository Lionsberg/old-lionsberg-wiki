# 1.1 Potential
There is more inside of you than you could possibly know.  Longing to emerge and [[Realize]] itself.

There is more inside of us than we could possibly know. Longing to emerge and [[Realize]] itself. 

And there is a very strange secret, which is that we cannot become who we were created to be, unless and until you become who you were created to be, and you cannot become who you were created to be, unless and until we become who we were created to be. 

This guide is written to those few open-minded pioneers who are willing to venture out beyond the [[Known]] with us, to discover and become together. 

What shall we discover and become? 

The most we can possibly be. 

How high can we go? What is the upper limit of our [[Potential]]?

We cannot even conceive of it. The only thing we know for certain is that it is far greater than anything we could imagine in our present state. 

Do not be like the thousands of dull and stagnant souls who die each day, never having really lived. 

Any breath may be our last, so this is always the moment to begin. 

Our [[Quest]] towards our [[Goal]] begins today. 

Today is the day of our Liberation.
