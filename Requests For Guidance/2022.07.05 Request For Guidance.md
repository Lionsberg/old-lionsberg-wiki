# 2022.07.05 Request For Guidance
Hello friends and allies, 

We are issuing this [[Request For Guidance]] at the outset of our third 6 Week Cycle. 

## A Social Experiment

At the start of the second quarter, we invited you to participate in or observe a social experiment. 

The idea was to take 6 weeks, and go through a loose integrated delivery process of 1) Intention 2) Analysis 3) Engagement 4) Planning 5) Action, and 6) Continuous Improvement to get a taste of what it might be like to attempt to work together on the One Thing that unites us all. 

The basic idea was to see if we could potentially forge: 
1. A global Meta Community / Federation  
2. Composed of sovereign and autonomous entities  
3. Engaged in a highest overarching and uniting [[Meta Project]], whose purpose was to  
	1. Sove the total set of grand challenges  
	2. Accomplish the total set of global goals  
	3. Forge the Best Possible Future for All  

Our hope was to find at least 6 to 12 people willing to advance.

## Cycle 2 Goals and Results

We ended up with a couple dozen consistent participants and a few dozen onlookers interested in seeing what would happen if we carried forward, so we prepared for a first "official" cycle. 

When it became evident we had the energy and alignment to advance, 8 weeks ago I sent out the far-too-long [[2022.05.09 Request For Guidance]]. 

It proposed 5 Next Steps for the 6 week cycle that just concluded on July 2: 

1) Formalize the gathering place where we can work on the One Thing that unites us all. 

2) Draft and adopt a minimum viable declaration / constitution that establishes right relationship among the sovereigns engaged in the federation. 

3) Resource the federation (Core Team and Infrastructure Fund), and the distributed network of high leverage projects (Impact Fund(s)), through the 501(c)(3).

4) Operationalize an Integrated Delivery System that creates throughput of the total nested set of goals. 

5) Advance the shared infrastructure platform that empowers the distributed network of autonomous sovereigns. 

It was a super ambitious slate of the basic elements required to advance the [[Critical Path]] path towards the [[Goal]]. 

The feedback to the Request For Guidance caused us to see the Wisdom in focusing on setting up the Patterns and Minimum Viable elements of each of these.

### Goal 1: A Place to work on the One Thing that unites us All. 
In response to Goal 1, we established multiple elements: 

1. A weekly meeting (Weekly at 12:20 to 2:00 PT, followed by a Retrospective that lasts until 2:30 PT)  
2.
