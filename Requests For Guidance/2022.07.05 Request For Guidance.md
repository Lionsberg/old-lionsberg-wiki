# 2022.07.05 Request For Guidance
Hello friends and allies, 

We are issuing this [[Request For Guidance]] at the outset of our third 6 Week Cycle. 

## A Social Experiment

At the start of the second quarter, we invited you to participate in or observe a social experiment. 

The idea was to take 6 weeks, and go through a loose integrated delivery process of 1) Intention 2) Analysis 3) Engagement 4) Planning 5) Action, and 6) Continuous Improvement to get a taste of what it might be like to attempt to work together on the One Thing that unites us all. 

The basic idea was to see if we could potentially forge: 
1. A global Meta Community / Federation  
2. Composed of sovereign and autonomous entities  
3. Engaged in a highest overarching and uniting [[Meta Project]], whose purpose was to  
	1. Sove the total set of grand challenges  
	2. Accomplish the total set of global goals  
	3. Forge the Best Possible Future for All  

Our hope was to find at least 6 to 12 people willing to advance.

## Cycle 2 Goals and Results

We ended up with a couple dozen consistent participants and a few dozen onlookers interested in seeing what would happen if we carried forward, so we prepared for a first "official" cycle. 

When it became evident we had the energy and alignment to advance, 8 weeks ago I sent out the far-too-long [[2022.05.09 Request For Guidance]]. 

It proposed 5 Next Steps for the 6 week cycle that just concluded on July 2: 

1) Formalize the gathering place where we can work on the One Thing that unites us all. 

2) Draft and adopt a minimum viable declaration / constitution that establishes right relationship among the sovereigns engaged in the federation. 

3) Resource the federation (Core Team and Infrastructure Fund), and the distributed network of high leverage projects (Impact Fund(s)), through the 501(c)(3).

4) Operationalize an Integrated Delivery System that creates throughput of the total nested set of goals. 

5) Advance the shared infrastructure platform that empowers the distributed network of autonomous sovereigns. 

It was a super ambitious slate of the basic elements required to advance the [[Critical Path]] path towards the [[Goal]]. 

The feedback to the Request For Guidance caused us to see the Wisdom in focusing on setting up the Patterns and Minimum Viable elements of each of these.

### Goal 1: A Place to work on the One Thing that unites us All. 
In response to Goal 1, we advanced multiple elements: 

1. A weekly meeting (Weekly at 12:20 to 2:00 PT, followed by a Retrospective that lasts until 2:30 PT)  
2. A [[Provisional Structure]] hosted by Lionsberg that allows us to gather and distribute resources, and interface with existing authorities  
3. A [[Chat System]] (MatterMost) that allows for groups, channels, topics, etc. The system is privately hosted and administered by an ally and core contributor to the [[Meta Project]] (Collective Sense Commons) which makes it far less likely to get cancelled.  
4. An Interoperable Database and Repository (Catalist) of people, organizations, and projects hosted by an ally and core contributor to the [[Meta Project]]. 
5. A Collaboration Platform (Open Impact) through which we will be able to coordinate, measure, and transact upon the Impact / Value that we create together.

### Goal 2: Minimum Viable Declaration / Constitution
In response to Goal 2, we determined that what would eventually become a constitution needed to begin as a living document that could be clarified and elevated over time. 

We drafted the following documents, which are currently in the process of being reviewed and improved. 

1. A simple [[Provisional Declaration]]  
2. A [[Meta Project Program Statement]]  

Over time, the Provisional Declaration will advance towards a full constitution, and the Program Statement will advance towards a fully articulated set of Plans and Specifications. 

### Goal 3: Resource the Federation
While we did not actually ask for or receive any funds, we significantly advanced our collective understanding of the architecture and theory associated with funding, and its various elements. 

In Q3 there are multiple opportunities present: 

1. We secured $15,000 in matching funds to begin a small initial raise. Would you be willing to help unlock these funds and set up the first $30K internal pool to steward?   
2. We are exploring combining infrastructure and networks with allies to empower a prototype fund that is planning to target a $500 Million raise.  
3. We are working on the architecture for multiple billion dollar "funds of funds" that will work together intelligently to progressively apply resources to measurable progress made that advances the [[Critical Path]] towards various goals.  

We are also exploring different sustainable "for-profit" and "non-profit" aspects of the Integrated System that could be prioritized and launched to sustainably generate funds through services and projects. 

### Goal 4: Integrated Delivery System
In response to Goal 4, we succesfully completed articulating the architecture of an Integrated Delivery System. 

This effort was aided by the provision of a starting point built through $10M+ of research and investment on how to most effectively execute 7 billion dollar projects simultaneously around the a single conceptual prototype and integrated Program of Action. 

The results of this effort can be found in the Lionsberg [[Integrated Delivery Guide]]. 

It should be noticed that this Integrated Delivery System has been purpose-built to Integrate with the [[Provisional Structure]].

In Q3, we will operationalize the [[0.2 Minimum Viable Version]] of the System, and begin making, securing, and tracking Commitments that produce Throughput of the Goal. 

### Goal 5: Advance the Shared Infrastructure Platform(s)
In response to Goal 5, we advanced: 

1. The [[Chat System]] (MatterMost)
2. The Collaboration System (Open Impact)
3. The Respositories (Catalist and Lionsberg Wiki)
4. The [Lionsberg Wiki](http:lionsberg.wiki)

### Additional Value Created 
Additionally, we created: 

1. A way for community members to easily set up blogs that integrate with and can refer to other elements of the Lionsberg Wiki. 
2. A way for community members to easily publish books. For a starting point, see the work we did with: 
	1. [[The Book of Lionsberg]] - 10% Work in Progress
	2. The [[Integrated Delivery Guide]] - 50% to 70% Work in Progress
	3. [[The Power of Today]] - 80% Work in Progress.
