I am adding stuff to this wiki because i'm excited and feel comfortable. I'm amazed that I am getting positive feedback. People here in the [[Meta Project]] seem to be genuinely interested in hearing each other. This is so unusual in modern life. It makes me feel at home, warm, relaxed and excited.

I've been thinking about trustworthy sources of news. Currating is time consuming.

I added a definitions for these pages:

- [[All]]  

We propose that **All** means trees, rocks, low income folks, wealthy folks, water.

- [[The Way/Concepts and Ideas/Meta Game]]  
- [[Meta Idea]]  

We propose that the **Meta Idea** is: We are wise. We make everything work smoothly, efficiently, benevolently, fast.

- [[Meta Intention]]  
- [[Meta Project]]  
- [[One Thing]]  

Regarding the [[The Way/Concepts and Ideas/Meta Game]], i've been thinking that we can have a ranking system for benefit created, or not. Value is similar to benefit but is easily gamed (pillaging, etc.) so some more thought is needed.
