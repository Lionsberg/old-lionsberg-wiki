A post in [[Above The Chaos By Jordan Nicholas]].

Hello Friends and Allies, 

Our new season got off the ground with more energy than we could have expected. 

Once we hit our internal coordinating limit given current patterns and infrastructure, I backed off public messaging to give us time to build the next phases of infrastructure and make sure we didn't create inbound that we were unable to handle. 

We are now ready to resume public broadcasting. 

The battle is still shaping up along three fronts, outlined below. 

If we are going to solve the crises and accomplish the goals inherent in this moment in history, at least three fronts are required: 

## Front 1: Connecting and Empowering the Global Community / Coalition of Goodwill 
Our first and primary focus of energy has been on connecting, equipping, and empowering the global community of goodwill. 

We are simultaenously co-creating both a powerful Community and Successor System that has the potential to be so far superior, it renders the Old obsolete. 

We are calling this effort the Lionsberg | Meta Project. 

To do this we have been hosting multiple weekly international convenings online, and engaging in weekly action to advance the infrastructure, frameworks and patterns of organizing across the lines that formerly divided us. 

What has emerged has been amazing. 

If you are intersted in an inside look at that is happening, check out the recent [[2022.07.05 Request For Guidance]], which is a richly linked resource to many elements that are alive right now. 

Just as an example, numerous forms of life are emerging, including green shoots of groups focused on areas such as: 

1. Declaration / Constitution Group  
2. Resourcing Group  
3. Program and Process Management Group  
4. Wiki Posse Group  
5. Start Page Keepers Group  
6. Map Weavers Group  
7. Social Dimmensions Group  
8. Interviewing Group  
9. Skills and Passions Group (concluding and folding into other Groups)  
10. Story Group  
11. Artifacts Publishing Group  
12. General Resources Group  
13. Effectiveness, Pragmatics, and Ethics Group  
14. Wisdom Seekers Group  
15. Community Currency Group  
16. Harvesting and Composting Group  
17. Plans and Specifications Group  
18. Governance and Patterns Group
19. Branding, Messaging, and Communications  Group
20. Kenya Group

With the basic infrastructure, patterns, and declarations in place, the next step is to begin coordinating and aligning resources and goals in service of the highest intention and greatest good that unites us. 

## Front 2: Leveraging Existing Systems of Justice to Hold Corrupt and Exploitative Actors Accountable 
Beyond our own experience with church and County governance, new evidence is surfacing every day highlighting how corrupt and dysfunctional our old leadership and institutions have become. 

In our own story, after 150 families lost their livlihoods and we lost our wealth, home, and reputation standing up to corrupt actors, we were unable to approach even the outer fringes of Justice through the mandatory mediation processes with Church and State. Bad actors do not show up in good faith. The good news is that our naivete has now been shattered entirely and we are more prepared and awake than ever for the battles that lie ahead. 

This week marks a milestone decision as the statue of limitations approachs, and we decide in the wake of failed mediation whether and how to leverage the existing systems of justice.

The reality is that thousands of cases like ours, and far more significant, will have to be litigated in order to get corrupt and bad actors to cease their exploitation of the earth and its inhabitants. 

Our hypothesis is that this will ultimately require us to take the immediate actions available to preserve our rights, as we co-create a powerful legal coalition / machine capable of advancing on many fronts simultaneously. 

## Front 3: Voting the Old / Corrupt Out, and the New / Aligned In. 
Just like our story is one example of thousands of legal battles that need to be waged over corruption, so too is our story one example of thousands of efforts that will need to be taken to vote the Old / Corrupt leaders out of offices around the world, and vote New / Aligned leaders in. 

We still cannot see any path we could personally take responsiblity for walking, that _might work_, that does not involve getting a strong, independent, non-corrupt leader into office in the US in 2024. This would allow us to work together to realign and redirect the might of the US in the second half of this decade in service of All. Because that will likely be one of the worst and most dangerous jobs in the world to tackle, we are still willing to risk our lives and reputations to confront the entrenched power structures and try. However unlikely it may be, there are a certain class of things, that you can never know whether they are true or possible, until you try. 

## None of This Can Succeed, Unless It All Succeeds
There is nothing in our backgrounds that demonstrates our qualifications for any of this. 

No part of this plan of action can succeed, unless it all succeeds simultaneously and in parallel. 

It might not work. 

The only was this will work is if, over the next 24 months, we collectively demonstrate the ability to partner with God to help the global community of goodwill recognize and organize itself under the One Thing that unites us All. 

If we can help inspire a global community to design and build _itself_, together we will be able to accomplish everything that must follow. 

If I look down and see my daughter and God's children around the world suffering in the kind of world that lies at the end of Society's current trajectory, the one thing that I want to be sure of is that I am indeed looking down, because I died trying. 

So - as unqualified as we might be, we have forged a meaningful global coalition, and have built the infrastructure and patterns to now see if it might be possible to broadcast and globally scale. 

Now we need your help. 

Because it is only a matter of time until we are deplatformed, we are building internal tech platforms and a mailing list 

For now - DM me or send an email to J@Lionsberg.org with your email if you'd like to follow along or support in any way, and we will connect you to the emerging community. 

I am currently not able to respond to every inbound message, but I will do my best to read them all and take wise next steps based on the content, offers, and needs expressed. 

It might work. What I know for sure is that directly ahead of us in a logical series of events, that _if_ we could get through them one by one, would definitively change the course of history. There is no ethical option available but to try to progress through them. 

For now, all that needs to happen is for the right next people to stand up. I hope that includes you. 

With Love, In Community,
