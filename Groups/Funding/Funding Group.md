Judith proposes we identify and discuss multiple strategies, approaches, execution, and potential outcomes. Identify various district areas, understand our position as a whole and as subsets of Meta, 
  
Iâ€™m particularly interested in contemplating how we would position ourselves (either Meta in totality or various subsets of Meta along the continuum), to enable approaches/actions/executions in multiple distinct areas as we go forward. Ultimately, I hope that we could demonstrate performance and outcomes that would not only provide robust funding for specific current and future initiatives, but would also foster an endowment strategy model for additional areas of opportunity and work.
