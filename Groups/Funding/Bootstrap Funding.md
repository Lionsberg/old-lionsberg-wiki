# Bootstrap Funding

_Page status: early draft_

At this early phase of our build-out of the meta project infrastructure, all our effort is voluntary and unpaid. We've discussed creating an internal fund to provide fellowships and stipends to those whose income cannot sustain this effort for much longer. We've concluded that keeping such highly motivated people in our efforts pool is important, perhaps even vital.

One strategy for creating this fund is something frequently followed in many startups: angel or bootstrap investors or donors. Write a minimum viable business plan that describes our infrastructural goals and delineates all costs including fellowships. The key quality of this plan is that it be compelling enough to the right people that they inject money into our bootstrap fund.

Furthermore, as we talk with people about bringing their technology into our infrastructure, likely they will want to know when we might become funded. Such a timeline (vague is better for some readers than nothing) can be part of this early bootstrap plan.

Probably we wish early stage funds to promise zero monetary ROI, so as to make them as effective as possible. Donors to non-profits are looking to see a job well done, have a positive impact. This might put a burden on us to measure this value, both ahead of time and later as proof of good effect. Typically several channels exist for such donations. Fiscal sponsorship, project designated funding, and general are the three main channels.
