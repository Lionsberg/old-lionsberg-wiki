# Guilds
Eventually, as sovereigns mature, they will combine autonomy and tradecraft with education. For the simple reason that each guild may prefer specialized in-house training for a lot of its skills. Generic education can then focus on a smaller set of common material. I call them guilds.

Since we plan to have a core advisory execution team, one of its roles can be to guide the formation and development of each sovereign into a mature guild.

## Guild Lifecycle
- Describe a need
- When the need reaches a threshold, create a sovereign
	- leader
	- purpose and responsibility statement
	- establish the initial team
	- articulate and design
		governance
		tradecraft
		training
- gradually operationalize the sovereign
- identify and acquire stakeholders
- become a guild
	- attract, onboard and train apprentices
