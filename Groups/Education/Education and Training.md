# Education and Training
Some skills have universal value. Empathy, the ability to accurately guess another's feelings or needs. Tolerance of difference, dissent, disagreement. The rewards that accrue from learning these skills are easily discerned and felt. The [training programs offered by the center for non-violent communication](https://www.cnvc.org/trainings) are excellent resources.

Focus on relationship and connection is of similar high worth. We are much more than their passions and skills. We have unique experiences, childhood traumas, physiological variances. Each time we meet, we learn more about all of this. The more we pay attention, the deeper our connection and the more valuable and mature our relationship.
