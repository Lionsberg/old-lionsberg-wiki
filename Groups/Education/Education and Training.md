# Education and Training
Students who work hard at learning will probably (?) do just fine with freely available (or reasonabily priced) high quality training. 

Some skills have universal value. Empathy, the ability to accurately guess another's feelings or needs. Tolerance of difference, dissent, disagreement. The rewards that accrue from learning these skills are easily discerned and felt. The [training programs offered by the center for non-violent communication](https://www.cnvc.org/trainings) are excellent resources.

Focus on relationship and connection is of similar high worth. We are much more than their passions and skills. We have unique experiences, childhood traumas, physiological variances. Each time we meet, we learn more about all of this. The more we pay attention, the deeper our connection and the more valuable and mature our relationship. Do we want to measure this? Is it possible? Harmful? What kind of training would work for most of us?

Within each sovereign, specialized skills are worth a lot. Who better than a member of the sovereign has the insight and experience to describe the skill, explain how to measure it, prepare teaching materials and train the teachers? 

Occasionally a sovereign may ask for general guidance. For this, the education and training group may choose to assemble guidelines and train facilitators ... meta-level trainers.
