Perhaps the most important relationship that a person can have when newly joining a sovereign is with an expert who wants to guide and nurture. This as hugely missing in modern life, and those who are lucky enough to have such a relationship speak of it in glowing praise. Let's create a world in which all of us have at least one such mentor throughout most of our lives.

A mentor suggests areas to work on, helps make needed resources available. They are trained to be nurturing, healing, a shoulder to cry on, an advocate in promulgating influence. Generally, they are a lifelong friend and expert.

Along the way, a mentor may notice that their apprentice is showing interest in a different sovereign and asks about it, possibly assisting with introductions into the other sovereign. This helps everyone involved.

Above all else, the mentor shall focus on the relationship with their apprentice and the latterâ€™s life goals.

Some skills have universally value. Empathy, the ability to accurately guess another's feelings or needs. Tolerance of difference, dissent, disagreement. The rewards that accrue from learning these skills are easily discerned and felt.
