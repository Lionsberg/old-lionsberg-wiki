# Education and Training
I think the most important relationship that a person can have when newly joining a sovereign is with an expert who wants to guide and nurture. I see this as hugely missing in most of our lives, and those who are lucky enough to have such a relationship speak of it in glowing praise. I envision a world in which all of us have at least one such mentor throughout most of our lives.

A master suggests areas to work on, helps make needed resources available. They are trained to be nurturing, healing, a shoulder to cry on, an advocate in promulgating influence. Generally, they are a lifelong friend and expert.

Along the way, a master may notice that the apprentice is showing interest in a different sovereign and asks about it, possibly assisting with introductions into the other sovereign. This helps everyone involved.

Above all else, the master shall focus on the relationship with the apprentice and the latterâ€™s life goals.
