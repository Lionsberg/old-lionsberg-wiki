# 2.4 Perception Is Not Reality
_"In order to begin to apprehend and comprehend the nature of the [[Living System]] in which we find ourselves, we must first learn to accurately differentiate between our [[Perception]] and [[Reality]]._  
 
_There is an [[Old]] saying bantered around in the [[Caves]] that “Perception is reality”._  
 
_While it is psychologically true that for the Observer chained in the Cave that the tiny fraction of 1% of the universe around us that we actually perceive feels like our reality…_ 

_…it is also true that there is another 99.999….% of objective [[Reality]] beyond our Perception that we are either incapable of seeing or are ignoring._
