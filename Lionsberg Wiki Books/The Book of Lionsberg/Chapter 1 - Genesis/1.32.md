We have crossed the [[Threshold]]. 

We have taken our first steps outside the [[Boundary]]. 

How do you feel? 

Isn’t it [[Beautiful]]? 





The [[Light]] can get blinding at first, but don’t worry, we will get used to it. 

Ah. Wait. 

I forgot, we don’t yet [[Know]] How or What to [[Perceive]] out here. 

Life outside [The Boundary] demands that we [Learn], or [Remember] how to [Embody], an entirely [New] yet [Eternal] [Way of Being] and [Perceiving].

  

The [Way of Being] and [Perceiving] that works to stay alive in the [Endarkenment] within the [Boundary] will get you killed outside the [Boundary]. 

  

We have left the [Old] behind, and we are now venturing out into something entirely [New].  

  

What are those maps and books [You] are carrying?
