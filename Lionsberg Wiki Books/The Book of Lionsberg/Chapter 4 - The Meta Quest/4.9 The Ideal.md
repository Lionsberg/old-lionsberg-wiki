# 4.9 The Ideal
The [[Meta]] One. 

The [[Ideal]].
 
That which is [[Most Worthy]] of awe, attention, imitation, and adoration.
 
Shining forth brilliantly from the heights of the sacred mountain where fully enlightening consciousness dwells. 
 
As our understanding and enlightenment grows in [[Community]], what else is there to do but work together to bring the highest [[Intention]] we can possibly fathom into reality? 

To elevate and transform our lives, our consciousness and our world FROM their current suffering and dysfunction, TOWARDS the Highest and Greatest of Which We Can Present Conceive?
