# 4.1 The Meta Quest
Ok. Now that we can [[Perceive]] and [[Move]] together, let us begin exploring. 

Ultimately we have to Succeed in the [[Meta Quest]], but for now we have a little time to explore, [[Orienting|Orient]] our Selves, and begin developing some basic shared skills, frameworks, and language that we will need to [[Journey]] together. 

What is a [[Quest]]? 

_A quest is a [[Journey]] toward a specific [[Mission]] or a [[Goal]]. In folklore, this word is often used to describe a difficult or epic [[Journey]] towards a great prize, which is often infused with sacred, symbolic or allegorical meaning. Tales of [[Quests]] figure prominently in the folklore of every tribe, nation and tradition._ 

What is [[Meta]]? 

The word [[Meta]] is used to describe something transcendent, beyond, self-referential, or of a higher order kind. 

In our [[New]] language, we are using it describe something of the [[Highest Order]] kind. 

The [[Meta Quest]] therefore is our highest overarching and uniting [[Journey]] towards our highest overarching and uniting [[Goal]] - the [[Meta Goal]]. 

By definition, the [[Meta Goal]] is the only possible Goal of the [[Meta Quest]]. They are each the Highest Order One of their kind.
