# Meta Project

The [[Universal and Eternal]] program of action to accomplish our highest overarching and uniting [[Meta Goal]]. 

The word [[Meta]] as it is used in the [[Lionsberg System]] is meant to point to the eternal, universal, ultimate, self-referential, highest order, most transcendent conception of an idea. 

Therefore **Meta Project** is the highest universal overarching and uniting "project of projects", that by definition contains within itself and orders all other possible projects.

The idea of the [[The Way/Concepts and Ideas/Meta Game]] is critical because it provides a framework in which to stack up and align our individual games, with the various games we participate in, with the [[The Way/Concepts and Ideas/Meta Game]] that is big enough to unite [[All]].  

We propose that the **Meta Project** is a fund generator for those projects which solve big problems or for components needed by them. Every aspect shall be ethical, wise, transparent, and humane. This means new ways of going about being human. We will incorporate them deeply, influencing everything.
