# One Thing

The [[Meta Idea]] of the [[Lionsberg System]] and the [[Meta Project]] is that there is **One Thing** that unites us [[All]].

We propose that **One Thing** is: We are wise. We make everything work smoothly, efficiently, benevolently, fast. Each of us is unique and well regarded. Everything and everyone matters. We play well with others.
