# Meta Intention

The word [[Meta]] as it is used in the [[Lionsberg System]] is meant to point to the eternal, universal, ultimate, self-referential, highest order, most transcendent conception of an idea. 

Therefore the **Meta Intention** is the highest universal overarching and uniting "Intention of intentions", that by definition contains within itself and orders all other possible intentions.

The idea of the **Meta Intention** is critical because it provides a framework in which to stack up and align our individual intentions, with the various intentions we participate in, with the **Meta Intention** that is big enough to unite [[All]].  

We propose that our **Meta Intention** is that every aspect of the [[Meta Project]] shall be ethical, wise, transparent, and humane. This means new ways of going about being human. We will incorporate them deeply, influencing everything.
