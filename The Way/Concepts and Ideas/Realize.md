# Realize

In the [[Lionsberg System]], [[Realize]] contains two distinct meanings, which are meant to interact with and inform each other. 

The first is realization in the spiritual and intellectual sense of the world, as in to become aware of or understand something. 

The second is realization in the physical sense of the world, as in to bring into embodied form in a time and place. 

For example, [[Lionsberg]] is an attempt to [[Realize]] the [[Meta Idea]]. 

These two elements can also be conceptually related to the interaction and [[Reciprocal Opening]] that occurs as a result of properly balancing [[Being]] and [[Doing]].
