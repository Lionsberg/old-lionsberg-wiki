# Meta Goal

The word [[Meta]] as it is used in the [[Lionsberg System]] is meant to point to the eternal, universal, ultimate, self-referential, highest order, most transcendent conception of an idea. 

Therefore the [[Meta Goal]] is the highest universal overarching and uniting "Goal of goals", that by definition contains within itself and orders all other possible goals.

The idea of the [[Meta Goal]] is critical because it provides a framework in which to stack up and align our individual goals, with the goals of the various things we participate in, with the [[Meta Goal]] that is big enough to unite [[All]].
