# Meta Goal

The word [[Meta]] as it is used in the [[Lionsberg System]] is meant to point to the eternal, universal, ultimate, self-referential, highest order, most transcendent conception of an idea. 

Therefore the **Meta Goal** is the highest universal overarching and uniting "Goal of goals", that by definition contains within itself and orders all other possible goals.

The idea of the **Meta Goal** is critical because it provides a framework in which to stack up and align our individual goals, with the goals of the various things we participate in, with the **Meta Goal** that is big enough to unite [[All]].  

So, what indeed is our **Meta Goal**?

We propose that our **Meta Goal** is to purpose-build an ethical, efficient, transparent, thriving way of going about human affairs. We intend for many wonderful qualities to emerge from this goal. Abundance, excitement, creativity, passion. We will draw from the best of human wisdom.
