# Meta Project Program Statement
This statement is a [[Work In Progress]]. It is a living document designed to be continously improved. 

## Executive Summary



## History and Context

In response to the emerging crises and failures of the [[Old System]] in the first decades of the new millennium, the development of the [[Meta Project Program Statement]] began, and gained steam in 2017.  The effort initially included strategists, designers, planners, programmers, technologists, attorneys, consultants and operations staff from a variety of organizations and viewpoints. It was expanded to include a growing array of perspectives between 2020 and 2022. 

During the first two quarters of 2022, an initial group of co-creators was invited to begin implementation of the Lionsberg | Meta Project Program of Action. 

This [[Meta Project]] is being forged in concert with a [[Meta Game]], a [[Meta Story]], and a  [[Meta Community]] that all share the same [[Critical Path]] and [[Goal]]. 

The [[Meta Project Program Statement]] and [[The Book of Lionsberg]] are both Works in Progress and are the initial efforts of the Receiver to distill wisdom from around the world and across the millennia, couple it with modern realities and best practices, listen carefully to the global community, and articulate a statement of the programmatic needs and solutions of a fully functional and flourishing [[New Era]] self-operated and self-sustained by a free, sovereign and empowered global community.   


## Why Build Anything At All? 


## What Shall We Build? 
Inspiring a global community to design and build itself, so that together we can design and build a better world. 

## An Integrated and Comprehensive Approach

## Higher Order Functional Unity

## Developing a [[Program of Action]]

The Receiver identified the need to design and build a new higher order system that integrated all underlying systems, resources, and energy into a functional unity that met the needs and solved the problems inherent in every individual, organization, and community on earth. 

## The [[What]] of the Program

### Characteristics of the New World 
The MPPS incorporates articulations of higher order systems of education, wellbeing, ecology, governance, administration, economy, culture and values, meaning, right relationship, and other information required for all generations of life to discover and achieve their unique potential, and flourish in harmony.

### Design and Programming Requirements

### Conditions of Satisfaction

## Major Features and Components of the Program
### The Prototype
he MPPS contains initial descriptions of the physical attributes, operational descriptions and requirements of of the primary elements that might be contained in the Prototype, which could be rapidly iterated, replicated and scaled relatively simultaneously around the world.

### Infrastruture
The rapid and simultaneous scaling of [[The Prototype]] through shared [[Infrastructure]] is a critical design criteria, given the urgent existential threats. 

### Services


### Interoperability
It is also critical that all replications of the Prototype contain the core architecture and system components that forge their **_networked interexistence and interoperability with the total System_**.


## How This Addresses the Spiritual, Intellectual, and Physical Needs of the Global Community





## Process For Continously Improving the Meta Project Program Statement
- Working sessions on various topics
- Site visits around the world to review existing and desired conditions


The MPPS describes a proposed [[New System]] that integrates and elevates all life without exception. The System will create an unprecedented wave of truly valuable and regenerative systems, facilities and infrastructure. These elements will create meaningful work, relationships, and quality of life for the global community over generations to come.

The architecture of the System is intended to encompass and elevate all aspects of the [[Human System]] and the [[Living System]] wihtout exception. All elements of the System will be built in a regenerative way that transforms the negative externalities associated with the Old World into a truly synergistic spiral of all life and systems upwards towards the [[Meta Goal]] of the Program.

The [[Core Enterprise]] will provide oversight of the MPPS to ensure it remains consistent with the Receiver’s Intention and Goal, is updated to reflect learning during design, build and operationaliation, and that constructed systems, facilities, and infrastructure comport with the design intent, which is the [[Highest Intention and Greatest Good]] for [[All]]. 

The latest edition of the living [[Meta Project Program Statement]] can be found [[Meta Project Program Statement|here]]. 
It will continue to be elevated and improved over time. 

___
The Prototype

The Program Manager and IPD Teams will use the information contained in the [[Meta Project Program Statement]] to design a prototypical higher order System purpose-built to deliver a continuously improving qualify of life for [[All]].

The Prototype will be developed to meet each of the [[Acceptance Criteria]] developed by the [[Meta Project Program Statement]] for the [[New World]].

**CONTEXT**

In our quest towards a better future, humanity and life on earth are facing an unprecedented complex of challenges and opportunities.

We are confronted by:

1.    A total set of challenges to solve  

2.    A total set of goals to accomplish  

3.    A mutual desire and ethical imperative to forge the best possible future for All  

**IMPERATIVE**

These imperatives call for creative and coordinated action at unprecedented scale.  

**CHALLENGES**

Yet at the very moment when we most need to work together, emergent solutions are hindered and society is inflamed by polarization, division, and unnecessary competition between us.  

This division and dysfunction is exacerbated by those abusing the positions and power with which we have entrusted them.  

**ACCELERATION**

These threats to our future loom ever larger as new tools and technology are leveraged to accelerate us along the wrong trajectories.  

**EPIPHANY**

What got us to this point is insufficient to get us to where we want to go.  

**GENERAL SOLUTION**

This demands the emergence of something massive, positive, and good that inspires the hope and courage that cause people to rise. 

The only force on earth capable of meeting this moment in history is a higher order and more perfect union among all people of goodwill. 

This functional unity must be forged such that it is actually capable of meeting the needs, accomplishing the goals, and solving the problems we face.

**THE CHASM**

While millions of people around the world recognize these realities, there is a gap between what ought to be, and what is.

**SPECIFIC SOLUTION**

We are coming together to inspire a global community community of goodwill to design and build itself, so that together we can design and build a better world. 

**Purpose**: The Lionsberg | Meta Project is a working prototype designed to bring our highest shared intention into reality.

**Intention**: Our intention is to create a place, system, and structure where we can work together towards the One Thing that unites us All. 

**Goal**: Our Goal is the total integrated wellbeing, development, and right relationship of all generations of life.

**Process**: Our process is the use of Integrated Delivery to bring the total nested hierarchy of goals into reality. 

**Mission**: Our mission is to serve, connect and empower individuals, organizations, and communities around the world. 

**Vision**: Our vision is a thriving and abundant world in which every being has the opportunity to develop into the fullness of their potential. It is a flourishing world that is becoming more perfect every day because we are working together to make it so. 

**Values**: We stand firmly upon the timeless shared values held by all people of goodwill, including Truth, Love, Justice, Stewardship, and Wisdom, and upon the Source and Sustainer from which they are our life are derived.
