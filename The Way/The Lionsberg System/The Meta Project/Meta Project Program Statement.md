# Meta Project Program Statement
This statement if a [[Work In Progress]]

Working with various experts across a broad spectrum of domains, the [[Receiver]] developed a draft [[Meta Project Program Statement]] (MPPS) that could be continuously improved. The MPPS describes the "What" of the Program. It describes the characteristics of the [[New World]] to be built. It also answers the "Why Build Anything At All?" question. 

The MPPS is emerging through numerous working sessions on various topics, as well as site visits to review existing and desired conditions in various domains. The MPPS is a key element in the planning of the Program and will be used throughout this guide to describe the design and programming needs and acceptance criteria of the [[New World]], along with the major features of the Program required to bring it into existence.
___

The Receiver identified the need to design and build a new higher order system that integrated all underlying systems, resources, and energy into a functional unity that met the needs and solved the problems inherent in every individual, organization, and community on earth. 

The programmatic components of the System were developed and are articulated in the [[Meta Project Program Statement]] (MPPS). The MPPS identifies programmatic components for the New World, and describes how they address the total spiritual, intellectual, and physical needs of the global community. It is intended to be a living document that continuously elevates as the elements of the program become more articulated and/or are adjusted as part of the continuous improvement program.

The development of the [[Meta Project Program Statement]] began in 2017.  The effort initially included strategists, designers, planners, programmers, technologists, attorneys, consultants and operations staff from a variety of different organizations and viewpoints. It was expanded to include a growing array of perspectives between 2020 and 2022. **_The MPPS and [[The Book of Lionsberg]] are both Works in Progress and are the initial best efforts of the Receiver to distill the wisdom from around the world and across the millennia, couple it with modern realities and best practices, listen carefully to the global community, and articulate a statement of the programmatic needs of a fully functional and flourishing New Era self-operated and self-sustained by a free, sovereign and empowered global community_**. The MPPS contains initial descriptions of the physical attributes, operational descriptions and requirements of of the primary elements that might be contained in the Prototype, which could be rapidly iterated, replicated and scaled relatively simultaneously around the world. The rapid and simultaneous scaling of [[The Prototype]] through shared [[Infrastructure]] is a critical design criteria, given the urgent existential threats. It is also critical that all replications of the Prototype contain the core architecture and system components that forge their **_networked interexistence and interoperability with the total System_**.  

The MPPS incorporates articulations of higher order systems of education, wellbeing, ecology, governance, administration, economy, culture and values, meaning, right relationship, and other information required for all generations of life to discover and achieve their unique potential, and flourish in harmony.

The sections of the [[Meta Project Program Statement]] include the following:

1. Why  
2. Basis of Design  
3. Intention  
4. Purpose and Meaning  
5. Alignment  
6. Culture and Values  
7. Right Relationship  
8. Learning  
9. Wellbeing  
10. Living System(s)  
11. Land  
12. Air  
13. Water   
14. Infrastructure  
15. Governance  
16. Administration  
17. Economy  
18. Spirituality  
19. Reconciliation  
20. Transforming Weaponry  
21. Flourishing  

The MPPS describes a proposed [[New System]] that integrates and elevates all life without exception. The System will create an unprecedented wave of truly valuable and regenerative systems, facilities and infrastructure. These elements will create meaningful work, relationships, and quality of life for the global community over generations to come.

The architecture of the System is intended to encompass and elevate all aspects of the [[Human System]] and the [[Living System]] wihtout exception. All elements of the System will be built in a regenerative way that transforms the negative externalities associated with the Old World into a truly synergistic spiral of all life and systems upwards towards the [[Meta Goal]] of the Program.

The [[Core Enterprise]] will provide oversight of the MPPS to ensure it remains consistent with the Receiver’s Intention and Goal, is updated to reflect learning during design, build and operationaliation, and that constructed systems, facilities, and infrastructure comport with the design intent, which is the [[Highest Intention and Greatest Good]] for [[All]]. 

The latest edition of the living [[Meta Project Program Statement]] can be found [[Meta Project Program Statement|here]]. 
It will continue to be elevated and improved over time. 

___
The Prototype

The Program Manager and IPD Teams will use the information contained in the [[Meta Project Program Statement]] to design a prototypical higher order System purpose-built to deliver a continuously improving qualify of life for [[All]].

The Prototype will be developed to meet each of the [[Acceptance Criteria]] developed by the [[Meta Project Program Statement]] for the [[New World]].
