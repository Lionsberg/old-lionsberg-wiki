# 2. Intention
This section of the [[Meta Project Program Statement]] is written to align the Community around the [[2. Intention]] and [[Goal]] of the Program. 

Like all elements of the Program, it merely reflects our [[Current Best Understanding]]. It is therefore a living document that should [[Get A Little Better Every Day]]. 

## The Meta Goal
As discussed in the introduction, the [[Highest Intention and Greatest Good]] flowing from the heart of [[Love]] is (something like): 

_The total integrated wellbeing, development, and right relationship of all generations of life._

The uniting desire is _for all generations of life to develop into the fullness of their unique potential, and flourish in harmony._

## Transformation
[[Realize|Realizing]] this [[Intention]] requires that we consciously transform our world into the kind of place where the [[Meta Goal]] is our experienced Reality. 

## Designing and Building the New World

Any building or system of reasonable complexity requires Plans and Specifications that articulate how all its subcomponents and systems should function together. 

If we are to succeed and avoid failure in this Program, the way we organize and govern ourselves as a human species will require no less. 

The following sections lay out an opening "back of the napkin" articulation of the major characteristics, features, and components we [[Imagine]] will need to be present in the [[Design]]. 

This back of the napking sketch should be further articulated by the Program [[Team|Teams]] teams in the [[Meta Project Plans and Specifications]]. 

## Conditions of Satisfaction
The integrated effort to Co-Create the [[New World]] should be continually measured against the [[Conditions of Satisfaction]]. 

The [[Conditions of Satisfaction]] should be further articulated in the Plan and Specifications. 

### The Meta Condition

The [[Meta Condition of Satisfaction]] is that whatever we co-create has to measurably and progressively accomplish the overarching and uniting [[Meta Goal]]. If it does not accomplish the Goal, the [[New]] has not be designed and built properly, and should be rejected by the global Community. 

Satisfying the Meta Condition inherently contains within itself the requirement to accomplish the [[Total Nested Hierarchy of Goals]], and the total nested hierarcy of Conditions of Satisfaction. 

We are rejecting the [[Old]] because it does not satisfy the Meta Condition, and we should reject the [[New]] for the same reasons if it is not adequate. 

### Subordinate Conditions of Satisfaction
In order for us to be satisfied with the New, the following qualities should be present: 

#### Characteristics of the New World
- The air is getting progressively purer and more alive over time
- The water is getting progressively purer and more alive over time
- The soil is getting progressively purer and more alive over time
- Every human being has the opportunity, encouragement, and empowerment to discover and achieve their unique potential in service of the Whole. 
- The entire Living System and all its inhabitants have the opportunity to discover and achieve thier unique potential in service of the Whole. 
- Developing and flourishing individuals are integrated into developing and flourishing families, teams and organizations. 
- Developing and flourishing individuals, families, teams, and organizations are integrated into developing and flourishing communities. 
- Developing and flourishing communities are integrated into the developing and flourishing [[Meta Community]]. 
- The developing and flourishing [[Meta Community]] is functionally integrating and elevating all generations of Life. 
- The entire System is being consciously directed across the generations towards its [[Highest Intention and Greatest Good]]. 
- All other characteristics implied by the [[Meta Condition]] and [[Meta Goal]] are being progressively articulated and fulfilled. 
- The entire System is Getting a Little Better Every Day, because all life is striving in harmony to make it so. 

### Design and Programming Requirements
It is anticipated that every element of above will require careful design, programming, and process considerations that _cause_ them to progressively become reality. 

These should be articulated in the Plans and Specifications. 

### Major Features and Components 
In order for the Conditions of Satisfaction to be met, it is anticipated that the following major features and components will have to be designed, built, and operationalized. 

Because we are looking at the [[New World]] through the lens of a single highest order System, all features below are described as systems in order to ensure that they imply everything necessary to integrate and function over time: 

#### 1. A Higher Order System of Learning
#### 2. A Higher Order System of Health and Wellbeing
#### 3. A Higher Order System of Human Development
#### 4. A Higher Order System of Organizational Development
#### 5. A Higher Order System of Community Development
#### 6. A Higher Order System of Governance
#### 7. A Higher Order System of Administration
#### 8. A Higher Order System of Economy
#### 9. A Higher Order System of Culture / Society
#### 10. A Higher Order System of Living Systems Integration
#### 11. A Higher Order System of Meaning and Spirituality
#### 12. A Higher Order System of Philosophy
#### 13. A Higher Order System of Wisdom, Principles, and Values
#### 14. A Higher Order System of Right Relationship
#### 15. A Higher Order System of Conciliation and Justice
#### 16. A Higher Order System of Help and Problem Solving




### Interoparability Among All Systems

### Design and Programming Requirements

Driving the costs of the deliverying the total nested hierarcy of goals towards zero over time, while progressivley increasing the quality. 


## Major Features and Components of the Program
### The Prototype
he MPPS contains initial descriptions of the physical attributes, operational descriptions and requirements of of the primary elements that might be contained in the Prototype, which could be rapidly iterated, replicated and scaled relatively simultaneously around the world.

### Infrastruture
The rapid and simultaneous scaling of [[The Prototype]] through shared [[Infrastructure]] is a critical design criteria, given the urgent existential threats. 

### Services


### Interoperability
It is also critical that all replications of the Prototype contain the core architecture and system components that forge their **_networked interexistence and interoperability with the total System_**.


## How This Addresses the Spiritual, Intellectual, and Physical Needs of the Global Community





## Process For Continously Improving the Meta Project Program Statement
- Working sessions on various topics
- Site visits around the world to review existing and desired conditions


The MPPS describes a proposed [[New System]] that integrates and elevates all life without exception. The System will create an unprecedented wave of truly valuable and regenerative systems, facilities and infrastructure. These elements will create meaningful work, relationships, and quality of life for the global community over generations to come.

The architecture of the System is intended to encompass and elevate all aspects of the [[Human System]] and the [[Living System]] wihtout exception. All elements of the System will be built in a regenerative way that transforms the negative externalities associated with the Old World into a truly synergistic spiral of all life and systems upwards towards the [[Meta Goal]] of the Program.

The [[Core Enterprise]] will provide oversight of the MPPS to ensure it remains consistent with the Receiver’s Intention and Goal, is updated to reflect learning during design, build and operationaliation, and that constructed systems, facilities, and infrastructure comport with the design intent, which is the [[Highest Intention and Greatest Good]] for [[All]]. 

The latest edition of the living [[Meta Project Program Statement]] can be found [[Meta Project Program Statement|here]]. 
It will continue to be elevated and improved over time. 

___
The Prototype

The Program Manager and IPD Teams will use the information contained in the [[Meta Project Program Statement]] to design a prototypical higher order System purpose-built to deliver a continuously improving qualify of life for [[All]].

The Prototype will be developed to meet each of the [[Acceptance Criteria]] developed by the [[Meta Project Program Statement]] for the [[New World]].

**CONTEXT**

In our quest towards a better future, humanity and life on earth are facing an unprecedented complex of challenges and opportunities.

We are confronted by:

1.    A total set of challenges to solve  

2.    A total set of goals to accomplish  

3.    A mutual desire and ethical imperative to forge the best possible future for All  

**IMPERATIVE**

These imperatives call for creative and coordinated action at unprecedented scale.  

**CHALLENGES**

Yet at the very moment when we most need to work together, emergent solutions are hindered and society is inflamed by polarization, division, and unnecessary competition between us.  

This division and dysfunction is exacerbated by those abusing the positions and power with which we have entrusted them.  

**ACCELERATION**

These threats to our future loom ever larger as new tools and technology are leveraged to accelerate us along the wrong trajectories.  

**EPIPHANY**

What got us to this point is insufficient to get us to where we want to go.  

**GENERAL SOLUTION**

This demands the emergence of something massive, positive, and good that inspires the hope and courage that cause people to rise. 

The only force on earth capable of meeting this moment in history is a higher order and more perfect union among all people of goodwill. 

This functional unity must be forged such that it is actually capable of meeting the needs, accomplishing the goals, and solving the problems we face.

**THE CHASM**

While millions of people around the world recognize these realities, there is a gap between what ought to be, and what is.

**SPECIFIC SOLUTION**

We are coming together to inspire a global community community of goodwill to design and build itself, so that together we can design and build a better world. 

**Purpose**: The Lionsberg | Meta Project is a working prototype designed to bring our highest shared intention into reality.

**Intention**: Our intention is to create a place, system, and structure where we can work together towards the One Thing that unites us All. 

**Goal**: Our Goal is the total integrated wellbeing, development, and right relationship of all generations of life.

**Process**: Our process is the use of Integrated Delivery to bring the total nested hierarchy of goals into reality. 

**Mission**: Our mission is to serve, connect and empower individuals, organizations, and communities around the world. 

**Vision**: Our vision is a thriving and abundant world in which every being has the opportunity to develop into the fullness of their potential. It is a flourishing world that is becoming more perfect every day because we are working together to make it so. 

**Values**: We stand firmly upon the timeless shared values held by all people of goodwill, including Truth, Love, Justice, Stewardship, and Wisdom, and upon the Source and Sustainer from which they are our life are derived.
