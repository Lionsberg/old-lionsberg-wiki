# Resourcing Guide
## Introduction

The human species in aggregate is facing a [[Meta Crisis]]. 

That Crisis contains within itself the greatest [[Meta Opportunity]] in history. 

This demands an unprecedented [[Meta Solution]] that is actually capable of solving the Meta Crisis and capturing the Meta Opportunity. 

Lionsberg is rising because we believe that a tremendous amount of suffering and death lies and at the logical end of humanity's current trajectory, and we are compelled to [[Act As If]] it were our responsiblity organize ourselves to do something about it. 

While it may not be enough, and while we may need to develop new and better ways of organizing ourselves, we know for certain that _it will require no less_ than the basic levels of competency that we use to organize any other significant human endeavor. 

We are therefore making an effort to encourage ourselves and our networks to rapidly level up to at least a basic level of aggregate coordinated competence. 

It is going to take legal infrstructure, process infrastructure, social infrastructure, technological infrastructure, communications and coordination infrastructure, and an absolutely world class effort to create a field of shared culture and values powerful enough to unite us above the lines that formerly divided us. 

We have been working at that the last several years, and places like the [[2022.07.05 Request For Guidance]], [[Provisional Structure]], and [[2022.Q2 Presentation of Value Creation]] contain information and links to get up to speed on some of the foundational work that has been going on below the ground.

When we use the term "we" below, we are referring to all of us, including you. Many people scoff if resource needs in the billions or trillions are casually thrown out, however there is already hundreds of billions of dollars a year in philanthropic capital and trillions of dollars a year in government capital flowing. 

The problem is how it is organized. 

And the Reality is that if we don't quickly figure out how to organize it better, society and life on earth are in trouble. 

Until we find out that someone else has it covered and our children, grandchildren, and entire living system are on a safe trajectory towards flourishing, we are going to [[Act As If]] it were our responsibility to reorganize it. 

So there we have arrived at the two main issues: 

How do we organize ourselves, and how do we organize our resources, so that they produce throughput of our highest overarching and uniting goals and values?

## Other Resources and Guides

This Guide focuses purely on Resourcing, however resources need to be applied to an entire System. For information on how people can organize their daily lives to produce throughput of the Goal, see [[The Power of Today]]. For information on how people can organize and federate to do things they can't do in isolation, see [[Organizations The Lionsberg Way]]. For information on how people, teams, and organizations can rise into higher order functional unity to accomplish a [[Total Nested Hierarchy of Goals]], see the [[Integrated Delivery Guide]]. For information on how federated groups can pragmatically structure themselves to protect the life that is emerging, and interface with the old world, see [[Provisional Structure]].

## Existing Context
It is increasingly obvious that the [[Vessel of Society]] has come unmoored and is careening towards the rocks of chaos. 

It is also increasingly obvious that it is dragging [[Vessel: Earth]] along with it. 

Aside from the mass extinction events of the past, which were driven by natural disasters, this _human_ driven trajectory towards ruin is the greatest threat that humanity and life on earth have faced. 

The good news is that because we are the ones setting the trajectory and accelerating ourselves along it, we also have the power to change it. 

Recognizing this, a growing wave of millions of people and billions of dollars are arising and beginning to move. Heroic efforts are being undertaken. 

However like the first stages after the alarm sounds and we realize the building is on fire, the movement is chaotic, uncoordinated, and disconnected. 

Despite our best intentions, we can clearly see that doing more of what got us to this point will not get us and life on earth to where it needs to go in order to not only survive, but _thrive_ in this new millennium. 

A massive and positive change is required. 

## What Resources Are Looking For
### Philanthropic Capital
Seeing the chaotic and disconnected array of efforts, and understanding that resources must be applied to solutions that are actually powerful enough to meaningfully move the needle and shift the trajectory, philanthropic capital is increasingly growing frustrated with the lack of high quality impact investment opportunities. 

### Investment Capital
Recognizing that they cannot keep fueling extractive economic systems that are antithetical to our goals and values, investment capital is increasingly growing frustrated with the lack of high quality investments opportunities into projects and organizations that advanding life on earth towrds flourishing. 

### Endowment Capital 

Recognizing that by investing in index funds and broad ETFs they are blindly providing fuel to extractive organizations that are creating many of the problems that their charters demand they solve, endowment funds are struggling to invest billions of dollars in a way that is consistent and aligned with the mission, vision, and values of the organizations they are intended to support. 

### Pension Capital
Pension funds, social security funds, and other major pools of capital face a similar ethical dillemma, and they struggle to find ways to invest massive pools of capital in a way that aligned with the values and best interests of those they serve. 

### A Scarcity of High Quality Impact Projects
In summary, nearly every capital group we encounter is expressing frustration with the scarcity of high quality projects to invest in that measurably move the needle and advance the critical path towards the Goal. 

## What Valuable Projects Are Looking For
### Financial Resources
On the flip side, potentially valuable impact projects and impact organizations feel scarcity in the reverse direction. Impact projects often feel stuck in a subordinated and disconnected position in relationship to the resource holders, and express concern and dismay at the lack of available funding, and the perceived social and political machinations that drive where funds ultimately flow. 

### Startup Resources



### Execution and Operational Resources
