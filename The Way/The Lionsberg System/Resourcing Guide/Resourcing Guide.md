# Resourcing Guide
The human species in aggregate is facing a [[Meta Crisis]]. 

That Crisis contains within itself the greatest [[Meta Opportunity]] in history. 

Lionsberg is rising because we believe that a tremendous amount of suffering and death lies and at the logical end of humanity's current trajectory, and we are compelled to [[Act As If]] it were our responsiblity organize ourselves to do something about it. 

While it may not be enough, and while we may need to develop new and better ways of organizing ourselves, we know for certain that _it will require no less_ than the basic levels of competency that we use to organize any other significant human endeavor. 

We are therefore making an effort to encourage ourselves and our networks to rapidly level up to at least a basic level of aggregate coordinated competence. 

It is going to take legal infrstructure, process infrastructure, social infrastructure, technological infrastructure, communications and coordination infrastructure, and an absolutely world class effort to create the field of shared culture and values. 

We have been working at that the last several years, and places like the [[2022.07.05 Request For Guidance]], [[Provisional Structure]], and [[2022.Q2 Presentation of Value Creation]] contain information and links to get up to speed on some of the foundational work that has been going on below the ground.

When we use the term "we" below, we are referring to all of us, including you. Many people scoff if resource needs in the billions or trillions are casually thrown out, however there is already hundreds of billions of dollars a year in philanthropic capital and trillions of dollars a year in government capital flowing. 

The problem is how it is organized. 

And until we find out that someone else has it covered and our children, grandchildren, and entire living system are on a safe trajectory towards flourishing, we are going to [[Act As If]] it were our responsibility to reorganize it. 

So there we arrive at the two main issues: 

How do we organize ourselves, and how do we organize our resources, so that they produce throughput of our highest overarching and uniting goals and values?
