# Organizations The Lionsberg Way
[[Organizations The Lionsberg Way]] describes pattens, processes, and tools that help independent and autonomous [[Indivual|Individuals]] form and organize independent and autonomous [[Group|Groups]] and [[Organization|Organizations]]. 

We are co-creating these recommendations in concert with various soveriegns in the coalition, and intend for them to reflect the [[Current Best Understanding]] of the [[Community]]. 

## Purpose of Organizations
Organizations emerge to help groups of people accomplish that that individuals cannot accomplish in isolation. 

Like an individual or other living being, once established organizations can move towards goals, learn, grow, sense, think, and die. 

## Mechanisms of Organization
1. An organization has a [[Purpose]], [[Principles]], [[Values]], and [[Goals]]. 
2. An organization should establish a basic system of [[Governance]] to steer itself towards its goals, solve problems, and make decisions. This can be formal or informal. 
3. An organization should define its [[Organizational Boundary]]. Organizations define their boundaries by creating rules of [[Participation]]. 
4. An organization should define its [[Rules of Participation]]. These can be formal or informal. 
5. An organization should define its [[Agreements]] that guide its internal and external relationships. These can be formal or informal. 
6. An organization should consider collaborating with other organizations to accomplish things that it cannot accomplish in isolation. This is a core behavior involved in [[Federating]]. 
7. To accomplish things, organizations use [[Projects]] and [[Process|Processes]]. 
8. At the highest level, an organization might view itself as a [[Project of Projects]], [[Process of Processes]] or a [[System of Systems]]. This creates a single overarching and uniting view of the organization as a whole. 
9. A good starting point is to consider that [[Everything Is A Project]]. 
10. Organizations can be contain organizations within themselves, and can be nested inside of higher order organizations. This is critical to establishing the fractal patterning that works towards the idea of the universal [[Meta Organization]]. 

## How to Co-Create an Organization

First of all, don't be scared. Go for it. Over time, we want to work together to make it very easy for anyone who wants to take action with others to be able to do so freely and joyfully. 

### Spotting the Opportunity to Organize: 
1. Pay attention to what is trying to emerge in conversation. Where are there potential or latent organizations that could come together, if they were noticed and attended to? 
2. Pay attention to what needs to happen. Where are there things that need to be done, that you are passionate about and qualified to do, that are not being done? 
3. Stone Soup: As you look at what is being cooked up in the field, what could you add that would make the collective experience even more delicious? 

### Establish a Center of Gravity
1. Forge a locus of communication and organization that begins to create an identifiable [[Center of Gravity]]. The simplest version of this is two or three passionate people. 
2. Choose a good descriptive [[Name]]. 
3. Set up a [[Chat Channel]]. 
4. If required, set up a place for [[Document Management]].

### Establish Purpose, Principles, and Goals
1. Establish the [[Purpose]] of the organization.
2. Establish the [[Principles]] and [[Values]] of the organization. 
3. Establish the [[Goals]] of the organization. 

### Align Goals with the Goals of One or More Federations
We would highly recommend that: 
1. Each [[Individual]] align their [[Goals]] with the [[Goals]] of one or more [[Group|Groups]] or [[Organization]],
2. Each Group and Organization align its Goals with the Goals of one or more Federation. 
3. All Federations align their Goals with the [[Meta Goal]] of the [[Meta Federation]]. 

### Co-Create It In The Open
We would recommend the steps above be followed so that it gets the green shoot of what is emerging above the ground where others can see it and help cultivate it if they are interested. A [[Pattern of Failure]] is to try to secretly perfect things in isolation. A [[Pattern of Success]] is to rapidly iterate and collaborate in the open.
