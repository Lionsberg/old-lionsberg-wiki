# 1.6 Critical First Steps Towards the Goal
The Program requires a number of critical first steps. The steps, listed below, are not in chronological order, but do reflect some of the major decisions and milestones. 

## 1.6.1 Meta Project Program Statement
Working with various experts across a broad spectrum of domains, the [[Receiver]] developed a draft [[Meta Project Program Statement]] (MPPS) that could be continously improved. The MPPS describes the "What" of the Program. It describes the characteristics of the [[New World]] to be built. It also answers the "Why Build Anything At All?" question. 

The MPPS is emerging through numerous working sessions on various topics, as well as site visits to review existing and desired conditions in various domains. The MPPS is a key element in the planning of the Program and will be used throughout this guide to describe the design and programming needs and acceptance criteria of the [[New World]], along with the major features of the Program required to bring it into existence. 

## 1.6.2 Integrated Program Delivery 
The PM is required to make recommendations on project delivery methodology and coordinate technological expertise with Integrated Project Delivery (IPD).  The PM and Receiver determined that responsibility for the design and the construction of the program components would be delegated to Integrated Project Delivery Teams using IPD. 

Integrated Project Delivery, using lean principles, was adapted from the manufacturing sector and is designed to maximize the efforts of all participants on the project to deliver the project at the lowest possible cost in the least amount of time that is practical for the project.  At the same time, quality and safety are continuously improved as project delivery progresses. IPD emphasizes planning and design with the entire design/build/operate team and uses both budget and schedule as design criteria.[[1]](#_ftn1)  Use of IPD and lean design/build/operate principles was consistent with the contractual mandate to “[develop and implement systematic approach(es) to ensure that design integrates cost, quality, schedule, constructability and value analysis as design criteria.”[[2]](#_ftn2)

The PM will establish design-build teams comprised of leading designers, impact organizations, builders, operators, and specialty trade partners.  The IPD Teams will engage to develop the prototype and design, construct and deliver the new world.
