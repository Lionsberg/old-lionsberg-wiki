# 1.7 Integrated Delivery
## 1.3.1 What is Integrated Delivery? 
Integrated Delivery is a philosophic apporach for designing a production or delivery system that maximizes [[Value]] creation, while progressively eliminating [[Waste]]. 

[[Value]] can be defined as [[Throughput]] of the [[Goal]] of the [[System]]. 

Simply put, Integrated Delivery uses lean design-build principles in a process-centered approach to developing and delivering a program of action.  Lean principles were originally implemented in manufacturing and first “discovered” by experts reviewing and documenting the Toyota Production System.  Toyota had shown great success with a new and different type of production line that required each step in the process to produce _only what was needed by the next step in the process_ and to view anything else as waste.  The behaviors and tools used by Toyota were documented and used to define a _lean_ _system_.

Subsequently, it has been discovered that these principles closely map to the way that living systems operate. Over time, the goal of the [[Lionsberg Integrated Delivery System]] is to continually merge the creative capacity of humanity towards harmony with the way Creation itself creates.  

**_The essence of Lean Integrated Project Delivery is to view any program of action as a UNIFIED SYSTEM properly designed to produce throughput of THE GOAL into reality. The Goal is to bring the Design Intent, as articulated in the plans and specification, and as understood through discernment and collaboration, into reality._** 

In the 1990s, various people in the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction industry began developing independent strategies for applying lean principles in the delivery of construction projects. 

When applied to construction, lean changes a project from a combination of activities to a system of dependent and variable tasks that must be managed based upon the unique human interactions that support work being done. In short, it transforms the [[Program of Action]] into a [[Goal Delivery System]]. 

The idea of a **_design build program as a system_** requires all participants to focus on the [[Flow of Work]] on the **_entire project_** and not just for activity optimization within their own silo. **_It requires that all participants work together collaboratively to optimize at the highest level, rather than sub-optimizing at the local level_**.  _Lean Project Delivery_, a term used to describe the application of lean to design-build projects, establishes a project where the owner, the design team, the builder and operational personnel work together to design a project that delivers the owner’s identified goals.  Thinking of a design-build project as a single collective enterprise requires readjusting traditional notions of project delivery and economy.  Like lean manufacturing systems, lean construction and Integrated Project Delivery embraces very specific behaviors and tools, which have a substantially beneficial effect on the entire project.

For the human species at this moment in history, if we do not rapidly embrace a higher order methodology to optimize at the highest integrated level for the wellbeing of [[All]], we will fail.

Let’s not fail.

## 1.7.2 The Five Big Ideas
As lean ideas were being implemented in manufacturing and construction, a set of foundational principles - the Five Big Ideas - were developed and clarified. 

1. Collaborate. Really collaborate. 
2. Increase Right-Relatedness among all [[Participants]]. 
3. Programs are [[Network of Commitments|Networks of Commitments]]
4. Optimize for the [[Whole]], not the pieces. 
5. Tightly couple [[Learning]] with Action. 

## 1.7.3 The Structure 
To implement the [[Five Big Ideas of Integrated Delivery]], the [[Program of Action]] needs a Structure purpose-built to create the conditions and incentives for this type of collaboration and relationship to flourish. See [[Provisional Structure]]. 

## 1.7.4 The Code
To implement the [[Five Big Ideas of Integrated Delivery]], the [[Program of Action]] needs not only a [[Provisional Structure|Structure]], but also a Behavioral and Cultural Code that makes Integrated Delivery possible. See [[Provisional Code]]. 

## 1.7.5 Integrated Delivery Behaviors and Cultural Code
Integrated Delivery requires specific behaviors and cultural norms in order to succeed.  These behaviors support a change in mindset **FROM** individual contracts and [[Self Optimization]]  **TO** a collective endeavor and global optimization.  Collaboration, trust, commitment-based management and continuous improvement are all behaviors required of each individual in an [[Integrated Delivery Environment]].  

Yet we know that laws and contracts are merely the faintest restraints on our worst impulses. It is hard to enforce behavior with laws and contracts. #principle 

When required “behaviors” are seen as the tools used to drive [[Value]] to the endeavor and drive waste and frustration out, they become more pragmatic strategies than social engineering. People need to see the pragmatic value in choosing one set of behaviors over another.

**_These behaviors are valuable because they lead to the collaboration and communication that is necessary to make any complex project successful_**.

Lean Integrated Delivery cultivates the development of teamwork, 

Lean [IPD] supports the development of team work and a willingness to shift burdens along supply chains. Partnering relationships coupled with lean thinking make rapid implementation possible. Where Partnering is about building trust, lean is about building reliability. Trust is the human attitude that arises in conditions of reliability. We are not likely to trust one another very long if we do not demonstrate reliability. Reliability is the result of the way systems are designed. Of course people manage systems and in current terms they do a fine job. The problem is that production systems just do not work well when every person tries to optimize their performance without understanding how their actions affect the larger web
