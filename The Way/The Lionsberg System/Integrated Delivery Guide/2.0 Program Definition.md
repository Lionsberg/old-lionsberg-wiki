# 2.0 Program Definition
## 2.1 The What and Why of the Program

The program objective - the answer to the question “why build anything" - was defined by the Receiver in the [[Meta Project Program Statement]], and in a more comprehensive way in the [[The Book of Lionsberg]]. This longer document lays out the Receiver’s initial attempt to forge a complete historical and philosophical understanding of [[Where We Are]], [[How We Got Here]], [[Where We Are Going]], and [[Why]] it matters. 

**_The Program is intended to encompass the total coordinated meta-level program of action / network of commitments required to get from where we are, to where we ought to go_**_._

The Program Delivery Guide lays out a System through which a global community of sovereign individuals, organizations, and communities can forge a functional unity to operationalize and accomplish the Program.

Program Development deals with the processes adopted and continuously improved to manage the continued development of the Program.

This Chapter describes the interplay between the New World Program Statement (the NWPS) and the development of the Program.  The NWPS describes how the New World to be built will deliver access to a continuously improving higher order system and quality of life for all life on earth.  This Chapter also discusses how the Prototype is being developed as a “kit of parts” (standardized fractal elements of the New World that can be combined in many different ways to serve the unique needs of each specific individual, organization and community) in order to accommodate the current and changing needs of global community’s population.  Built into the design of the Prototype is both quality (standard quality packages) and safety (designing elements to be built, installed and operated in a safer manner). 

Important to the delivery of the Program is determining the **_availability and priority of sites for implementation of the various elements of the System_**, and the opportunities and constraints each potential site brings.  In addition to basic implementation challenges, these constraints include environmental challenges, political challenges, and social challenges. Potential sites whose feasibility has been established will require various mitigation measures to **_ensure that the transformation of the local site helps, and does not harm, the existing ecology or community._**

The initial Meta Project analysis phase revealed a variety of entrenched government, corporate, and criminal organizations whose positions of power and wealth very much depend on keeping local communities and ecosystems poor, in the dark, and exploited. **_These organizations will not readily stop this exploitation, and thefore a robust plan of security, enforcement, and transformation with some significant strength and teeth in it will need to be developed_**. This issue must be stared straight in the face, and Program participants trained and prepared for inevitable backlash from existing forces who oppose the Program.  

Guideline development and program validation support the utility of convening a System-wide Global Community Master Planning process for determining exactly how New World services can be delivered and maintained around the world with continuously improving levels of quality and reliability. The Master Planning effort will continue to inform the NWPS and will impact how each project within the Program is delivered.  **_A coordinated System for delivering the basic resources, infrastructure, and services that solve the problems inherent in every individual, organization and community is necessary to achieve the goals of this Program; therefore a system-wide approach is needed._**

It is critical that this System-wide master planning, and the total effort to design, build, and activate the New World System, is never divorced from its fundamental unity and harmonization with the living system that supports and sustains all life. A central element of this Program is the re-integration of human life, consciousness, systems, and society with the total living system so that all life can flourish in harmony over millennia. **_There is only one New World, and it belongs to all its inhabitants across all generations of life_**. 

Finally, this Chapter considers what Program support is necessary and how that will be provided through the SLE and its constituent parts.  This will include technology, financial management, operational management, cultural management, dispute resolution and necessary reporting and communication, both internally among IPD Teams, and outwardly to the global community.
