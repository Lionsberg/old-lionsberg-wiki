# 1.5 Guilds
The large scale decentralized and coordinated activity required necessitated that the [[Federation]] discern how it would organize itself to train, equip, and empower the vast array of [[Functions]] that would be required for it to succeed as a [[Whole]] in its [[Mission]]. 

## 1.5.1 Capacity Building 
One core function of the [[Guilds]] would be to build capacity in key functional areas across the distributed network of [[Sovereigns]] in the [[Federation]]. 

## 1.5.2 Functional Accountability
A second core function of the [[Guilds]] would be to establish [[Core Team|Core Teams]] who would be accountable for the proper functioning of their unique part of the [[Whole]].  

## 1.5.3 Organs in a Body
A metaphor was established to reflect that the [[Whole]] needed to operate as if it were a single body. In this metaphor, each guild would represent the [[Functions|Function]] of a particular organ or organ system. 

## 1.5.4 The Program and Process Management Guild
Given the scope and complexity of the total [[Program of Action]] that the [[Receiver]] needed to undertake, it was apparent early on that one of the core functions that would need to emerge early was [[Program and Process Management]]. 

The [[Core Team]] of the [[Program and Process Management Guild]] would be responsible for acting as an agent and liason of the [[Receiver]] to integrate and coordinate the diverse [[Functions]], [[Process|Processes]], and activities of the [[Whole]] as it worked together to produce [[Throughput]] of the [[Goal]].
