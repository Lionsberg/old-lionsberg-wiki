# 3.3 Communications and Reporting
Every relationship requires [[Communication]]. 

In an Integrated Delivery System, everything is related. 

Because it is not possible for [[All]] to communicate with [[All]], each element of the [[Federation]] must communicate directly with those it works with, as well as the Whole. 

## Minimum Viable Communications
The entire Lionsberg idea and community is designed to operate as a single Integrated Delivery System that produces [[Throughput]] of [[Intention Into Reality]]. 

As a result, there are certain [[Minimum Viable]] Communications standards that must be honored by [[All]] in order for the System to function. 

These minimum standards can be thought of in three distinct baskets: 

1. Communications that are internal to a working team or organization
2. Communications between teams and organizations that are _directly related_ and impact each others [[Flow of Work]]. 
3. 

### Internal Communications

### Communications Between Directly Related Elements

### Communications With The Whole
