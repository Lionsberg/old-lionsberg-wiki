# 0.5 A Teacher is Only a Guide
We have discovered that we cannot actually teach. 

We can only guide those who genuinely want to learn. 

We can show you the Way towards the Goal, however you are the hero who must voluntarily choose to embark with your whole being on a journey to progressively discovering and becoming your destiny. 

You are the one who must be willing to venture out of the Old into the New and Uknown. 

You are the one who must test yourself, forge yourself, and transform yourself into the kind of being that is able to navigate through the dangers, toils, and snares of Unknown, to reach the Noble Goal of [[Your Quest]]. 

But do not worry, do not be afraid. We will be right there beside you, walking with you, progressing with you. We too have our own feet on the path. We too are still learning and progressing. 

In fact, the farther we have travelled in the Way, the farther we realize we are away from the Goal. 

It is a strange, mysterioius, wonderful and intoxicating thing when you realize that there is more within you and more beyond you than you can possibly imagine, and that it is possible to bring those things into ever greater unity, even as the perceived distance between them grows. 

This is one of the many mysteries of the Way. 

However to truly know and understand these words, you will have to venture out and experience the Reality beyond your existing Boundary.
