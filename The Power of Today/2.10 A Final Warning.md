# 2.10 A Final Warning
It bears repeating - it is absolutely critical, and of utmost importance, that You VERY CAREFULLY choose Your [[Aim]], and ensure that it is [[Good]]. 

Just like You never point a gun at something You are unwilling to shoot, NEVER point this System at something You are not willing to see become Your lived [[Reality]]. 

These are powerful tools. Make sure that You use them _only_ for the [[Highest Intention and Greatest Good]]. 

When You are ready, We will begin showing the [[Way]] to operate Your [[New]] [[System]].
