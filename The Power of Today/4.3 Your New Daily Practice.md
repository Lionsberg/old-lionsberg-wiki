# 4.3 Your New Daily Practice 
If You have not already mastered or transcended a [[Daily Practice]] that _causes_ every day to be great, and to produce [[Throughput]] of what You [[Value]] the most, here is a starting point, purpose-built to work with the rest of the [[Lionsberg System]]. 

It is a Integrated System designed to elevate and transform Your entire Being, Spiritually, Intellectually, and Physically. 

Because the System is rooted in the [[One]] Highest and Deepest thing, it includes references to the English words commonly used to point at such things, including [[God]] and [[Prayer]]. 

We recognize how problematic and misused the word [[God]] has become, so please look beyond the [[Word Tool]] to the Ultimate Reality it is pointing at, and feel free to modify the words to reflect [[One]] highest Overarching and Uniting thing You can relate to.

Step 1: Wake Up with gratitude that You woke up. Before You get out of bed, and at the earliest moment You can remember, say a quick Prayer of gratitude, and commit Your day to God - to the [[One]] and the [[All]]. 

Step 2: As you get out of bed, use the restroom, and wake up, DO NOT pollute the purity of Consciousness that You gained during sleep by going on your phone, computer, tablet, or other device.
