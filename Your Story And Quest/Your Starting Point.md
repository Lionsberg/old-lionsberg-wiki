# Your Starting Point
Hello, welcome to the Lionsberg Meta Project and Community. We are glad you are here! 

Until we have a better [[Orientation and Onboarding Process]] up and running, this page is intended as a simple way to help you get quickly oriented and connected. 

## How We Use The Word Meta
You may have arrived here by hearing about Lionsberg, or about the [[Meta Project]], [[Meta Game]], or [[Meta Story]]. Before you go further, it might be helpful to understand how we are using the word [[Meta]]. 

The word [[Meta]] as it is used in the [[Lionsberg System]] is meant to point to the most eternal, universal, ultimate, self-referential, highest order, most transcendent conception of an idea. 

## The Meta Story
If you haven't seen it yet, you may want to spend a few minutes to read the simple working version of [[0.3 The Meta Story|The Meta Story]].  

The Meta Story is intended to begin laying out an overarching and uniting story of where we are, how we get here, where we are going, and why it all matters. 

## The Meta Project | The Meta Quest
The [[Meta Idea]] that we are here to work together towards something that is bigger than any of us. 

We are each working on important projects, and yet at the same time as a human species on planet earth the totality of all our human endeavors could be viewed in the context of a single overarching and uniting program of action we call the [[Meta Project]]. 

We are each engaged in various individual and group [[Quest|Quests]] towards various individual and group [[Goal|Goals]]. A
