I propose definitions for these pages:

- [[All]]  

**All** means trees, rocks, low income folks, wealthy folks, water.

- [[Meta Idea]]  

The **Meta Idea** is: We are wise. We make everything work smoothly, efficiently, benevolently, fast.

- [[Meta Intention]]  

Our **Meta Intention** is that every aspect of the [[Meta Project]] shall be ethical, wise, transparent, and humane. This means new ways of going about being human. We will incorporate them deeply, influencing everything.

- [[Meta Project]]  

The **Meta Project** is a fund generator for those projects which solve big problems or for components needed by them. Every aspect shall be ethical, wise, transparent, and humane. This means new ways of going about being human. We will incorporate them deeply, influencing everything.

- [[One Thing]]  

**One Thing** is: We are wise. We make everything work smoothly, efficiently, benevolently, fast. Each of us is unique and well regarded. Everything and everyone matters. We play well with others.
